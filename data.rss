<p>Today, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Marcia Fudge, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, and Council of Economic Advisers Chair Cecilia Rouse hosted a virtual event with CEOs and senior executives across the housing and homebuilding sector to discuss supply chain disruptions in the homebuilding industry as well as shortages in the availability of homes for purchase and rent. The convening included housing advocates and representatives from builders, lumber companies, retailers, realtors, loggers and labor unions, as well as other companies and organizations focused on homebuilding and affordable housing. &nbsp;<br><br>The U.S. has a longstanding shortage of affordable housing, and participants discussed how that challenge is being exacerbated by short-term supply chain disruptions across the homebuilding sector, including fluctuations in lumber prices, supply chain disruptions in other critical inputs including resins and engineered wood products, transportation challenges with ports and trucking, and underinvestment in training and skilled workforce development.&nbsp;<br><br>Participants discussed core challenges across the housing supply chain, and helped Administration leaders collect additional input to inform the Administration’s near- and medium-term efforts to further strengthen housing supply. Participants also focused on the demand for housing and how the President’s necessary and historic investments in the Build Back Better agenda will expand housing supply and strengthen the country’s affordable housing stock.</p>

<p>11:07 A.M. EDT</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Good morning, and thanks for joining us.&nbsp;<br><br>Today, Dr. Walensky will provide an update on the state of the pandemic and the Delta variant.&nbsp; Then, Dr. Fauci will present the data from other countries facing the Delta variant.&nbsp; I will provide an update on how we’re working on a number of fronts to manage this virus.&nbsp; And Dr. Murthy will discuss vaccine confidence with a focus on combatting misinformation and disinformation.&nbsp; And then we’ll open it up for a few questions.<br><br>Now, over to you, Dr. Walensky.<br><br>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Let’s begin with an overview of the data.<br><br>Yesterday, CDC reported more than 33,000 new cases of COVID-19.&nbsp; Our seven-day average is about 26,300 cases per day, and this represents an increase of nearly 70 percent from the prior seven-day average.<br><br>The seven-day average of hospital admissions is about 2,790 per day &#8212; an increase of about 36 percent from the previous seven-day period.&nbsp; And, after weeks of declines, seven-day average daily deaths have increased by 26 percent to 211 per day.<br><br>Today, Dr. Fauci and I want to provide some perspective about these numbers and how we should be thinking about where we are at this critical moment in the pandemic.<br><br>There is a clear message that is coming through: This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated.&nbsp; We are seeing outbreaks of cases in parts of the country that have low vaccination coverage because unvaccinated people are at risk.&nbsp; And communities that are fully vaccinated are generally faring well.<br><br>You can see the patterns of local outbreaks in the slide of community transmission.&nbsp; The blue and yellow counties have low or moderate transmission.&nbsp; The orange and red counties have substantial to high transmission.&nbsp; On the left, you can see where we were just a short month ago, and compare it to where we are now, on the right.&nbsp;<br><br>In the last week, 10 percent of counties have moved into “high transmission risk,” in the red, and 7 percent of counties have moved into “substantial risk,” in the orange.&nbsp; Those counties most frequently correspond to counties with low vaccination rates.&nbsp;<br><br>When we look over time, we can put these increasing cases in perspective.&nbsp; In January, shown in the middle of the slide, we were averaging nearly 200,000 cases per day.&nbsp; The entire country was in a high level of transmission.&nbsp;<br><br>You can see that from January to June, as you move from left to right on the slide, we made remarkable progress, where the percent of counties with high transmission decreased &#8212; as shown by the decrease in red, and increases in blue and yellow.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, in the upper righthand corner, which is where we are today, you can see the recent growth in cases where the red and orange are again increasing.&nbsp; So, while we are in a far better position than we were in January through April, this increased in red area is giving us all a reason to double-down and get more people vaccinated.<br><br>The good news is that if you are fully vaccinated, you are protected against severe COVID, hospitalization, and death, and are even protected against the known variants &#8212; including the Delta variant &#8212; circulating in the country.<br><br>If you are not vaccinated, you remain at risk.&nbsp; And our biggest concern is that we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and, sadly, deaths among the unvaccinated.<br><br>Lastly, I want to reiterate the importance of getting fully vaccinated.&nbsp; I want to reiterate that people who got the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are most effective, especially when &#8212; against the Delta variant when given as two shots in a series.&nbsp;<br><br>Both vaccines are most effective two weeks after the second dose, with each exceeding 90 percent effectiveness against severe disease, hospitalization, and death in real-world studies.&nbsp; Not completing the series puts those partially vaccinated at risk of illness.&nbsp;<br><br>We encourage that people get vaccinated on schedule three or four weeks after your first dose.&nbsp; But if you are beyond that window, I want to reiterate: There is no bad time to get your second shot.<br><br>Do it for yourself, your family, and for your community.&nbsp; And please do it to protect your young children who, right now, can’t get vaccinated themselves. &nbsp;<br><br>With that, I will now turn it over to Dr. Fauci.<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Thank you very much, Dr. Walensky.&nbsp; I&#8217;d like to continue it along the lines that Dr. Walensky had mentioned, but now maybe take a look at it from a global standpoint, if I could have the first slide.&nbsp;<br><br>Clearly, the Delta variant is dominant in the world.&nbsp; If you look at this map of the world, they&#8217;re at about 100 countries that have now have the Delta variant that is detected in them in June of &#8212; since June in 2020.&nbsp;<br><br>Next slide.&nbsp;<br><br>If you look at the average daily prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant worldwide, if you look at the righthand part of the slide, you see the extraordinary surge in the dominance of this variant worldwide.&nbsp;<br><br>And we, as was mentioned in several briefings that we&#8217;ve had, are seeing increment in our own country to the point of now having more than 50 percent dominance and, in some areas of the country, greater than 70 percent.<br><br>That is the sobering news, but take a look at what&#8217;s going on worldwide with hospitalizations.&nbsp; Although Israel has the same issue with the dominance of the Delta strain, their hospitalizations have dramatically diminished.&nbsp; And if you look at the far right of the slide, as of just a couple of days ago, they are very low. &nbsp;<br><br>In the next slide, we see the UK.&nbsp; Similar.&nbsp; A dramatic diminution in hospitalizations.&nbsp;<br><br>However, if you look at the trend on the far righthand part of that slide, there’s that uptick, which somehow was reflecting what Dr. Walensky just told you about the slight uptick that we&#8217;re seeing in hospitalizations in our own country.&nbsp;<br><br>Next slide.&nbsp;<br><br>However, we know that the vaccines that are listed on the lefthand part of this slide that are being used in this country &#8212; namely the Pfizer, Moderna, and the J&amp;J &#8212; both in lab studies and in clinical effectiveness studies show the effectiveness of these vaccines against the Delta variant, particularly, and importantly, against hospitalization.&nbsp;<br><br>Next slide shows data from the UK with the Delta variant, which the Pfizer-BioNTech, which clearly reflects what we&#8217;ll be seeing with Moderna, is 96 percent effective against hospitalization.&nbsp;<br><br>The bottom line is: We are dealing with a formidable variant in the Delta variant, as reflected by the data that Dr. Walensky told you, and the extreme vulnerability of people who are not vaccinated, which will account for infections, hospitalizations, and, ultimately, deaths.<br><br>And so the message loud and clear that we need to reiterate is that these vaccines continue to strong protection against SARS-CoV-2, including the Delta variant.&nbsp; And so &#8212; why it&#8217;s so important for yourself, your family, and your community to get vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>Back to you, Jeff.&nbsp;<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Well, thank you, Dr. Fauci and Dr. Walensky.<br><br>Stepping back, we have come a long way in our fight against this virus.&nbsp; Because we have fully vaccinated more than 160 million Americans, we&#8217;ve fundamentally changed the course of this pandemic from one that puts the lives and livelihoods of all Americans at risk, to one that predominantly threatens unvaccinated people.<br><br>As Dr. Walensky said, as the more transmissible Delta variant continues to spread across the country, we will likely continue and experi- &#8212; continue to experience an increase in COVID cases in the weeks ahead, with these cases concentrated in communities with lower vaccination rates.&nbsp;<br><br>In fact, just four states accounted for more than 40 percent of all cases in the past week, with one in five of all cases occurring in Florida alone.&nbsp; And within communities, these cases are occurring primarily among unvaccinated individuals.&nbsp;<br><br>At the same time, as Dr. Fauci said, because we have so many people fully vaccinated, including about 80 percent of seniors &#8212; those who are most vulnerable, those over 65 years of age &#8212; we will likely see smaller increases in hospitalizations, similar to the Israel and UK experience.&nbsp;<br><br>The bottom line continues to be very, very simple: While fully vaccinated individuals have a high degree of protection against serious illness from COVID-19, including the Delta variant, unvaccinated Americans are not protected against serious illness, hospitalization, and death.&nbsp;<br><br>And we&#8217;re seeing it in the data.&nbsp; Unvaccinated Americans account for virtually all recent COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths.&nbsp; Each COVID-19 death is tragic.&nbsp; And those happening now are even more tragic because they are preventable.&nbsp;<br><br>Every American 12 and older, no matter where they live, has vaccines readily available to them.&nbsp; So, if you are unvaccinated, please get vaccinated now.&nbsp; The vaccines work.&nbsp; It’s safe, it’s free, it’s readily available, and it’s never been more important.<br><br>As we manage this virus, our whole-of-government effort continues to work to get more people vaccinated, address areas where we’re seeing outbreaks among the unvaccinated, and prepare for every scenario.<br><br>First and foremost, we continue to vaccinate hundreds of thousands of new people each day &#8212; meeting unvaccinated Americans where they are, answering their questions, helping them make up their mind, and making it even easier and more convenient to get a shot as soon as they are ready to do so.<br><br>We’re doing this by trus- &#8212; by entrusting and empowering messengers &#8212; trusted messengers &#8212; to have the conversations we know work&nbsp;&#8212; whether it’s vaccinated people in communities across the country talking directly to their neighbors, sharing their own vaccination journey and answering question; or it’s Olivia Rodrigo using her voice and platform to spread the word.<br><br>We’re working with doctors, pharmacists, employers, educators, and school administrators to bring vaccines to where people are.<br><br>And as Dr. Murthy will discuss, we’re taking disinformation and misinformation head on.<br><br>We continue to see efforts to deliberately mislead the American people about the importance of vaccination.&nbsp; Those who peddle and promote these dangerous lies are harming the very people who are most at risk and furthering a pandemic that has already taken more than 600,000 American lives.<br><br>We are calling on everyone &#8212; social media platforms, news organizations, individual Americans &#8212; to call this activity out and to help get the facts out to your friends, families, and communities so that we&#8217;re protecting our fellow Americans, not purposely putting them in harm’s way.<br><br>As I said last week, vaccinating more and more Americans each day is an individual-by-individual, community-by-community effort.&nbsp; And this type of localized, person-to-person approach takes some time, but it is working.<br><br>In the past 10 days, 5 million Americans have rolled up their sleeves to get a shot in their arms, and millions more Americans will get vaccinated across the summer months.<br><br>Importantly, states with the highest case rates are seeing their vaccination rates go up.&nbsp; In fact, in the past week, the five states with the highest case rates &#8212; Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Missouri, and Nevada &#8212; had a higher rate of people getting newly vaccinated compared to the national average.<br><br>At the same time, our COVID-19 Surge Response Teams are working with governors and local public health officials to provide specific federal resources and capabilities to fight outbreaks due to the spread of the Delta variant.<br><br>We are already helping many states to identify and address specific needs, including testing, therapeutics, and vaccinations.&nbsp; And this week, at the request of the Nevada governor, we are deploying more than a hundred people to the state to help enhance vaccine access and support vaccine outreach efforts.<br><br>And we’re providing CDC’s technical expertise &#8212; including on genetic sequencing, data analysis, and outbreak response &#8212; to Missouri to help support the state in its response.<br><br>We stand ready to support our state partners with the help they need to curb the spread of the virus and increase vaccinations in their states.<br><br>And finally, we continue to be prepared for any and every scenario, including the possibility of booster shots, if and when the science shows they are needed.<br><br>At this time, the CDC and FDA have said Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot.&nbsp; Independent and rigorous scientific CDC and FDA processes will determine if and when boosters are needed and who might need a booster shot.<br><br>I want to be clear: The science will guide this.&nbsp; And as Dr. Walensky and Dr. Fauci are making clear, this is a question that they are continually evaluating.&nbsp; We are ready for whatever the science tells us.<br><br>We have secured enough vaccine supply, and, if needed, we will ensure Americans who might need a booster shot are able to get it quickly and easily.&nbsp;<br><br>Before I turn it over to Dr. Murthy, let me reiterate: The best thing we can do right now is to get more Americans vaccinated.&nbsp; Every person matters.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every shot matters.&nbsp; Every shot is progress.&nbsp; It’s another life protected.&nbsp; It’s another community that is safer.&nbsp; It’s another step toward putting this pandemic behind us.<br><br>Now, let me turn to Dr. Murthy. &nbsp;<br><br>Dr. Murthy.<br>SURGEON GENERAL MURTHY:&nbsp; Well, thanks so much, Jeff.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s great to be with all of you again today.&nbsp; For months, on these briefings, we&#8217;ve talked about barriers to getting vaccinated.&nbsp; And today, I want to focus on the challenge of health misinformation that&#8217;s affecting millions of Americans.&nbsp;<br><br>Yesterday I issued a Surgeon General&#8217;s Advisory on the dangers of health misinformation.&nbsp; Surgeon General Advisories are reserved for urgent public health threats.&nbsp; And while those threats have often been related to what we eat, drink, and smoke, today we live in a world where misinformation poses an urgent and insidious threat to our nation&#8217;s health.&nbsp;<br><br>Health misinformation is false, inaccurate, or misleading information about health according to the best evidence at the time.&nbsp; And during this pandemic, health misinformation has led people to resist wearing masks in high-risk settings; to turn down proven treatments &#8212; in some cases to turn to unproven treatments and to choose not to get vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>All this has led to avoidable illnesses and deaths.&nbsp; Simply put, health misinformation has cost us lives.&nbsp; And just this week, I traveled to New Mexico to meet with youth leaders, clinicians, and public health leaders from across the state.&nbsp; And the common thread that ran through our conversations was their struggle to help their communities navigate information about COVID-19.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, health misinformation has been a problem long before COVID.&nbsp; What&#8217;s different now is the speed and scale at which health misinformation is spreading.&nbsp; If we want to address health misinformation, we&#8217;ll need an all-of-society response, and that&#8217;s why the advisory has recommendations for everyone.&nbsp;<br><br>First, we include recommendations for individuals and families.&nbsp; We&#8217;re asking people to raise their bar for sharing health information by checking sources before they share information to ensure it&#8217;s backed by credible, scientific sources.&nbsp; As we say in the advisory: If you are not sure, don&#8217;t share.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re also asking other organizations to do their part in every sector from health and education, to research and journalism, to philanthropy and government.&nbsp;<br><br>But very importantly, technology companies must act as well.&nbsp; Technology companies have enabled misinformation to poison our information environment with little accountability to their users.&nbsp; It allowed people who intentionally spread misinformation &#8212; what we call “disinformation” &#8212; to have extraordinary reach.<br><br>In this advisory, we&#8217;re telling technology companies that we expect more. &nbsp;We&#8217;re asking them to operate with greater transparency, to modify their algorithms to avoid amplifying misinformation, and to swiftly and consistently take action against misinformation super-spreaders on their platforms.<br><br>Shortly after releasing the advisory, we saw organizations &#8212; like the Rockefeller Foundation, the Digital Public Library of America, and the American Academy of Pediatrics &#8212; step up and respond to this call to action by committing their time, resources, and networks to confronting health misinformation.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;m encouraged by these commitments because turning the tide against health misinformation will take all of us.&nbsp; The longer we wait, the more lives we lose.&nbsp;<br><br>As someone who has lost 10 family members to COVID-19 and who wishes each and every day that they had had access to the vaccine, it&#8217;s painful to know that nearly every death we are seeing now from COVID-19 could have been prevented.&nbsp;<br><br>The truth is that, across our nation, the voices of doctors, nurses, scientists, and public health experts are too often being drowned out by the false sirens of misinformation.&nbsp; Misinformation robs us of our freedom to make decisions for our health based on science and facts.<br><br>Addressing health misinformation is an urgent challenge, a moral and civic responsibility that we must meet together.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why I issued the Surgeon General Advisory.&nbsp; You can read the full advisory at SurgeonGeneral.gov/HealthMisinformation.<br><br>Thanks for your time.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll pass it back to Jeff.&nbsp;<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Well, thanks, Dr. Murthy.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s take a few questions.&nbsp;<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks, Jeff.&nbsp; We only have time for a few questions today.&nbsp; First, let&#8217;s go to Carl O&#8217;Donnell at Reuters.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, and thanks for taking my question.&nbsp; I just was wondering if you guys could share a little bit more detail on the current state of thinking around boosters.&nbsp; I know you&#8217;ve said and other persons have also said that they&#8217;re not needed now.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve heard some commentary though, suggesting that among immunosuppressed people and the elderly, they might be needed.&nbsp; Maybe, you know, latter part of this year, early next year &#8212; just curious.<br><br>I also know that there can be higher risk of side effects, potentially, with a third booster shot.&nbsp; So, just curious if you can offer any additional color.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr Fauci?&nbsp;<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Yes, well, as Dr. Rochelle Walensky has said multiple times, the CDC is looking at a number of different cohorts that will get the information that will be needed &#8212; as she said &#8212; if and when and to whom we will be giving boosters.&nbsp;<br><br>I think we should be making sure people understand &#8212; because the question often gets asked, particularly among the unvaccinated &#8212; &#8220;If you&#8217;re talking about boosting people, does that mean that the vaccines don&#8217;t work?”&nbsp; That&#8217;s not the case at all.&nbsp;<br><br>We are dealing with highly effective vaccines.&nbsp; When you talk about a third shot for a two-shot vaccine regimen or another shot for the J&amp;J single-dose regimen, you&#8217;re talking about enhancing the durability of an already highly effective vaccine.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s the thing that&#8217;s being actively studied right now.&nbsp;<br><br>So, literally, in real time, we talk about this literally on a daily basis, and evidence is being accumulated on a daily and weekly basis.&nbsp; And when we get enough information to make that decision, then that decision will be forthcoming.&nbsp;<br><br>But as we&#8217;ve all said: At this particular time, right now, we don&#8217;t recommend that there be boosters for people.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; I just want to also be very crystal clear from an operational perspective: We&#8217;re prepared for every scenario, including the possibility of boosters, if and when the science, as Dr. Fauci said, shows that they are needed.&nbsp; If and when.&nbsp;<br><br>So we&#8217;ve secured enough vaccine supply.&nbsp; And if needed, we&#8217;ll ensure Americans who might need a booster shot are able to get one quickly and easily.&nbsp;<br><br>The science, as always, will guide us.&nbsp; And as Dr. Walensky and Dr. Fauci have said &#8212; they&#8217;ve made it very clear &#8212; this is a question that they are continually evaluating.&nbsp;<br><br>Next question.<br><br>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; And maybe &#8212;<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Oh, go ahead, Dr. Walensky.&nbsp; Please.<br><br>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; I was just going to say, with regard to the immunosuppressed population, this is a little bit of a different scenario where we might be concerned that in fact they didn&#8217;t get full protection from their initial two doses, so we would be looking at a third prime dose in that situation.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s a situation that the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is going to look at next week.&nbsp;<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Thank you, Dr. Walensky.<br><br>Next question.&nbsp;<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Go to Erin Billups at Spectrum News.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Thank you for taking my question.&nbsp; Younger unvaccinated people we&#8217;ve spoken to believe they will likely be fine if they get infected with coronavirus.&nbsp; So, wondering if you all can paint a picture of who is actually being hospitalized by the Delta variant.&nbsp; Is the rate of younger people being hospitalized by coronavirus now any different than what we were seeing at other &#8212; during other surges in the pandemic?&nbsp; And are we seeing any breakthrough infections among more vulnerable people who have been vaccinated who might have been around younger people?&nbsp; Is there any more data you can share with us?&nbsp;<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr. Fauci?<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Well, with regard to the breakthrough infections that we&#8217;re seeing: So, certainly, we are seeing them, but you got to remember what the denominator of the vaccinated people are.&nbsp;<br><br>When you&#8217;re talking about young people, specifically, getting hospitalized, we are seeing younger people hospitalized right now, relatively speaking to a more extent than we were before.&nbsp; Because when we did not have the large group of elderly people vaccinated, then the elderly people dominated the people who were hospitalized and got into trouble.<br><br>Since we have more of a veil of protection among people &#8211;because about 85 percent of people who are elderly, greater than 65 are vaccinated &#8212; when you look at the relative number of people who get hospitalized, clearly, we&#8217;re seeing younger people, from a relative standpoint, more hospitalized than we were seeing before because of the shift of the veil of protection, which is much more dominant among the elderly.<br><br>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; And maybe I&#8217;ll just add: When we look at the age demographics of people being hospitalized now, we are seeing them go up in all age demographics, exactly as Dr. Fauci noted, differently for the vaccinated and unvaccinated.&nbsp; But, importantly, over 97 percent of people who are entering the hospital right now are unvaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Next question.&nbsp;<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Kaitlan Collins at CNN.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve got two questions: one on breakthrough cases and then a second one on some news that just broke.<br><br>One, for these breakthrough cases, are they contributing to the spread of coronavirus?&nbsp; Or is it mainly unvaccinated people that that&#8217;s happening since this is, as Walensky phrased it, “a pandemic of the unvaccinated.”&nbsp;<br><br>And secondly, Pfizer just announced that the FDA has granted a priority review designation for their application for approval of their vaccine.&nbsp; They said the goal date for a decision is January 2022.&nbsp; So does that mean we&#8217;re not going to see full approval for their vaccine until January 2022?&nbsp; Or is that just a “must have decision by” date.&nbsp;<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; So, Dr. Fauci on breakthrough cases.&nbsp;<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Well, what we do know in the cases that were looked at: If you are vaccinated and you get infected, and you compare that person &#8212; if you&#8217;re an asymptomatic infected breakthrough vaccinated case &#8212; and compare that to someone who is infected but not vaccinated and asymptomatic, the level of virus in the nasal pharynx of the vaccinated person is considerably less than the virus in the nasal pharynx of a person who is infected, unvaccinated, and asymptomatic.&nbsp;<br><br>Based on that, you could make a reasonable assumption that the rate of transmissibility from the asymptomatic vaccinated person to an uninfected person would be less likely than if the person was unvaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>But the actual studies to do whether or not the transmission occurs is a large study that&#8217;s ongoing right now.&nbsp; So, Kaitlan, we don&#8217;t have the data &#8212; the clinical data &#8212; but I think one can make the reasonable assumption based on the level of virus in the nasal pharynx that it would be less likely that that vaccinated breakthrough person would transmit, compared to an unvaccinated person.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; And, Kaitlan, on the second question, we’ll defer to the FDA.&nbsp;<br><br>Next question.&nbsp;<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Last question.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Zeke Miller with AP.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you all for doing this.&nbsp; The President, yesterday, said that he was hoping for a timeline &#8212; to set a timeline for lifting some travel restrictions in the next couple of days.&nbsp; I was hoping you could talk about the objective metrics that you&#8217;re looking to present to the President for when some of these travel restrictions can be eased.&nbsp;<br><br>And then, secondly, to Dr. Walensky’s point a few minutes ago that this is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated: How does that change the administration&#8217;s response to the pandemic?&nbsp; Is it a different sort of strategy?&nbsp; Does it mean that large-scale mitigation measures, if we start seeing cases going up &#8211;you know, mask mandates and the like &#8212; are not necessary because so many people are vaccinated?&nbsp; How does it change the strategy going forward?<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr. Walensky, do you want to take the second question?&nbsp; And then I&#8217;ll make a comment on international travel.&nbsp;<br><br>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Yeah, absolutely.&nbsp; Thank you, Zeke.&nbsp; You know, as we have said, this is very heterogeneous across the country and these decisions have to be made at the local level.&nbsp; If you have areas of low vaccination and high case rates, then I would say local policymakers might consider whether masking at that point would be something that would be helpful for their community until they scale up their vaccination rates because more people than not in the community are unvaccinated.<br><br>SURGEON GENERAL MURTHY:&nbsp; And, Jeff, can I just add &#8212;<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Please.<br><br>SURGEON GENERAL MURTHY: &#8212; on thought there?&nbsp;<br><br>You know, this strategy &#8212; as we think, going forward, about how to get the rest of the country vaccinated &#8212; has got to involve everyone.&nbsp; Look, there&#8217;s a lot government can do.&nbsp; There’s a lot that we are doing and we&#8217;ll continue to do more, but this is a moment where we need technology companies to step up and do more to stop the spread of misinformation.&nbsp;<br><br>We want to work closely with schools and employers to get their help, increasingly, in getting people vaccinated in schools and in workplaces.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s also going to take each one of us, you know, as Americans across this country, looking to our family and our friends and asking them if they are vaccinated.<br><br>You know, this vaccination campaign is going to move, in part, driven by trusted relationships.&nbsp; And so, if you&#8217;ve got people in your life who trust you, who look to you for advice, then you have the power to help them get them accurate information and help get them vaccinated and protected from COVID-19.&nbsp; It will take all of us.&nbsp;<br><br>I think governments can play an important role here, but this has got to be an “all of the above” strategy with everybody in.&nbsp;<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; So, lastly, on international travel, you know, we&#8217;ve made, as we talked about today, important progress on the pandemic.&nbsp; At the same time, we have an increase in cases and the existence of the Delta variant.&nbsp; We’ll continue to put public health first.&nbsp; Any decision about opening international travel will be guided by our public health and medical experts.&nbsp; And they&#8217;ll be looking at many metrics, including case rates, vaccination rates, and the prevalence of any variants, including the Delta variant.<br><br>As you heard yesterday, the President said that we will be planning to update him in the next few days on the metrics and on the public health, and we must remain vigilant, particularly about the spread of variants.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll reopen when the medical folks and the health experts believe it&#8217;s safe to do so.&nbsp;<br><br>I want to thank everybody for joining today&#8217;s briefing and look forward to next week.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;<br><br>11:38 A.M. EDT<br><br>To view the COVID Press Briefing slides, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/COVID-Press-Briefing_16July2021_for-transcript.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/COVID-Press-Briefing_16July2021_for-transcript.pdf</a></p>

<p>Today President Joseph R. Biden Jr. participated in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Virtual Leaders’ Retreat, hosted by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand.<br><br>President Biden welcomed the opportunity to directly engage with APEC Leaders. He underscored the importance the United States places on the region, noting that we are a Pacific nation and vowing that the United States will remain deeply engaged in the region for generations to come. President Biden emphasized the importance of multilateral cooperation and reiterated his commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. He put forward a vision for the region that is affirmative, values-based, and transparent.<br><br>President Biden articulated the U.S. approach for ending the pandemic and outlined our global vaccine strategy, whereby the U.S. is donating more than half a billion safe and effective vaccines to more than 100 countries in need around the world, several of which are APEC economies. He made clear that the United States is donating our vaccines, not selling them, and underscored the importance of not attaching any political or economic conditions to the provision of vaccines. Our singular goal remains saving lives. President Biden also discussed the importance of investing in better global health security and preparedness so that we are ready the next time we face a pandemic.<br><br>On the global economic recovery, President Biden reaffirmed the U.S. interest in serving as a strong, reliable partner to APEC economies as we pursue sustained and inclusive growth. He discussed ways to unleash the economic power of the region and to deepen U.S. economic engagement throughout the Indo-Pacific, including through the recently announced Build Back Better World partnership, which will provide high-standard, climate-aligned, and transparently financed infrastructure to APEC economies that need support.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice and White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director Julie Rodriguez convened the inaugural meeting of The White House Community Violence Intervention (CVI) Collaborative, a 16-jurisdiction cohort of mayors, law enforcement, CVI experts, and philanthropic leaders committed to using American Rescue Plan funding or other public funding to increase investment in their community violence intervention infrastructure. Investing in evidence-based, community violence interventions to reduce gun violence is a key pillar of President Biden’s comprehensive strategy to prevent and respond to gun crime.</p>



<p>The Collaborative will spend the next 18 months strengthening and scaling the jurisdictions’ community violence intervention infrastructure to reduce gun crime and promote public safety. The effort will include peer-to-peer learning and community-based evaluations to strengthen the existing evidence base for community violence interventions. National experts and federal agencies will provide training and technical assistance to help communities assess their existing public safety ecosystem, identify gaps, and build the capacity to expand programming that saves lives—both this summer and beyond.</p>



<p>During the meeting, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice stressed that through American Rescue Plan funding and other investments, cities have a historic opportunity to invest in building out their community violence prevention and intervention infrastructure. Intergovernmental Affairs Director Julie Rodriguez thanked mayors and other participants for their leadership and underscored the value of sharing best practices and lessons learned through the Collaborative.</p>



<p>Several mayors in attendance highlighted their efforts to support community violence interventions through the use of American Rescue Plan funds, and how the Collaborative will allow them to strengthen their programs. Community violence intervention experts, who will be lending their decades of expertise to the Collaborative, noted the historic nature of this White House initiative.</p>



<p>Participants in the meeting represented the following jurisdictions:</p>



<ul><li>Atlanta, GA</li><li>Austin, TX</li><li>Baltimore, MD</li><li>Baton Rouge, LA</li><li>Chicago, IL</li><li>Detroit, MI</li><li>King County, WA</li><li>Los Angeles, CA</li><li>Memphis, TN</li><li>Miami-Dade, FL</li><li>Minneapolis &amp; St. Paul, MN</li><li>Newark, NJ</li><li>Philadelphia, PA</li><li>Rapid City, SD</li><li>St. Louis, MO</li><li>Washington, DC</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>From the founding of our Nation to today, through the crucibles of war and the struggle of successive generations, America has strived to uphold the ideals of freedom and democracy upon which our country was built and expand the ability of people around the world to freely exercise their rights.&nbsp; As the world&#8217;s longest-standing democracy, we carry a special responsibility to lead at home and abroad, not only by the example of our power, but by the power of our example &#8212; to prove to ourselves and to the world that democracy can deliver for all people.&nbsp; Though much has changed in the world since President Eisenhower issued the first Captive Nations Proclamation in 1959, its call for liberty and opportunity still ring true.&nbsp; During Captive Nations Week, we recommit ourselves to those principles which form the foundation of our Nation, and to amplify the voices of courageous individuals around the world who are striving to advance the principles of human rights, justice, and the rule of law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, far too many people are subject to routine abuses of power, as oppressive governments detain, harass, or commit acts of violence against dissenting voices; disseminate disinformation and propaganda; undermine democratic systems; and otherwise violate the public trust.&nbsp; These abuses are not new &#8212; but they remain as stern a threat to human rights and freedom as they have ever been.</p>



<p>No nation or person of conscience can ignore the voices of those crying out for liberty.&nbsp; We hear Belarusians peacefully calling for democratic elections, and the courageous people of Hong Kong demanding the autonomy and liberty promised by Beijing under the Sino-British Joint Declaration and Hong Kong&#8217;s Basic Law.&nbsp; We hear millions of Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minorities in Xinjiang, China, who have been unjustly interned and subject to surveillance and forced labor.&nbsp; We hear the determination of those rejecting military rule in Burma, resisting dictatorship in Venezuela, taking to streets in Cuba to demand freedom in the face of brutal state repression, and pressing for free and fair elections in Nicaragua &#8212; as well as the Crimean Tatars, ethnic Ukrainians, and other ethnic and religious minorities who suffer repression for opposing Russia&#8217;s illegal occupation of Crimea.</p>



<p>The American creed, which defines our Nation, proclaims that all people are created equal, and deserve to be treated equally, with dignity and respect, throughout their lives.&nbsp; We stand in solidarity with the brave human rights activists and pro-democracy advocates around the world who risk their lives for the rights of others. &nbsp;We are committed to ensuring that all those who are oppressed across the globe &#8212; including people with disabilities, women and girls, members of the LGBTQI+ community, indigenous populations, and racial and ethnic minorities &#8212; are heard, respected, and protected.</p>



<p>During Captive Nations Week, we recommit ourselves to the timeless, vital work of advancing freedom and justice for all. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We do that by forging a more equitable and inclusive society, by solving problems and helping to ease the burdens people face, and by fulfilling our role as a global leader for human rights and fundamental freedoms of expression, association, peaceful assembly, and religion or belief.&nbsp; Together with our allies and partners, we must continue to strengthen democratic institutions, defend independent civil society and media freedom, promote free and fair elections, protect human rights online, insist on accountability for those who commit abuses and foster cultures of corruption, and push back against authoritarianism around the world.</p>



<p>The Congress, by joint resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the third week of July of each year as &#8220;Captive Nations Week.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim July 18 through July 24, 2021, as Captive Nations Week.&nbsp; I call upon all Americans to reaffirm our commitment to championing those around the world who strive for liberty and justice for all.</p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.<br></p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">East Room</p>



<p>5:16 P.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;<br>PRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you all. Please have a seat. Today, it&#8217;s been my great honor &#8212; and I mean that &#8212; to welcome a dear friend back to the White House.<br>&nbsp;<br>And before I say anything else, Chancellor Merkel, I want to express to you and to the people of Germany my sincere condolences and the condolences of the American people for the devastating loss of life and the destruction due to the flooding over the past 24 hours in Germany and neighboring countries. It&#8217;s a tragedy, and our heart goes out &#8212; our hearts go out to the families who&#8217;ve lost loved ones.<br>&nbsp;<br>Chancellor Merkel has been here frequently over the past 16 years. Matter of fact, she knows the Oval Office as well as I do. But all kidding aside, through &#8212; though this administration &#8212; she&#8217;s been there for four years &#8212; for four Presidents.<br>&nbsp;<br>But I want to take a moment to acknowledge the historic nature of her chancellorship. First woman chancellor in German history. The first chancellor from the former East Germany. And now, the second largest &#8212; longest-serving chancellor since Helmut Kohl. Here&#8217;s an exemplary life of groundbreaking service to Germany and, I might add &#8212; and I mean it from the bottom of my heart &#8212; to the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>On behalf of the United States, thank you, Angela, for your career of strong, principled leadership. And thank you for speaking out for what is right and for never failing to defend human dignity.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I want to thank you for your continued support for the longstanding goal of a Europe whole, free, and at peace. You&#8217;ve been a stalwart champion of the Transatlantic Alliance, the Atlantic Partnership.<br>&nbsp;<br>Under your chancellorship, the friendship and cooperation between Germany and the United States has grown stronger and stronger.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I&#8217;m looking forward to celebrating more at our dinner this evening, but today was very much a working visit. Chancellor Merkel and I covered a wide range of issues where Germany and United States are working to advance a shared agenda. We discussed, together with our fellow major democracies at the G7, Germany and the United States have responsibilities to lead with our values, as do the other members of NATO.<br>&nbsp;<br>And today, I&#8217;ve &#8212; I&#8217;ve confided that in our new Washington Declaration, which we&#8217;ve codified &#8212; a document affirming our commitment to the democratic principles that are the heart &#8212; that are at the heart of both of our nations, and how we will apply them to meet the biggest challenges of today and tomorrow.<br>&nbsp;<br>Both our nations &#8212; both our nations understand the imperative of proving that democracies can deliver the needs of our people in the second quarter of the 21st century. We will stand up for democratic principles and universal rights when we see China or any other country working to undermine free and open societies.<br>&nbsp;<br>And we are united &#8212; united in our commitment to addressing democratic backsliding, corruption, phony populism in the European Union or among candidates for the EU membership or anywhere we find it in the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>We agree on the importance of further integrating the Western Balkans into the European &#8212; into European institutions and in our continued support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the continued importance of reforms in the support of their Euro-Atlantic aspirations.<br>&nbsp;<br>We stand together and will continue to stand together to defend our Eastern Flank allies at NATO against Russian aggression. And while I rere- &#8212; while I reiterated my concerns about Nord Stream 2, Chancellor Merkel and I are absolutely united in our conviction that Russia must not be allowed to use energy as a weapon to coerce or threaten its neighbors.<br>&nbsp;<br>And today, we&#8217;re launching a climate and energy partnership to support energy security and the development of sustainable energy, sustainable energy technologies, and emerging &#8212; and emerging economies, including in Central Europe and Ukraine.<br>&nbsp;<br>To unite our efforts to upend and &#8212; on our global climate ambitions that we have to up-the-ante, what happened is we talked about when Paris Accord was set, we thought we had established just how serious it was, but things have gotten much more dire since even that date. And to unite our efforts to update and to up-the-ante on global climate &#8212; on global climate ambitions.<br>&nbsp;<br>I also thank Chancellor Merkel for the dedication and the sacrifice of German troops who have served side by side along with U.S. forces in Afghanistan for almost 20 years.<br>&nbsp;<br>And we reaffirmed our shared commitment to continuing to counter terrorist threats where we find them, including in the Sahel in Africa.<br>&nbsp;<br>And we &#8212; when we think about the future, the future we want for the world, there is no issue &#8212; there&#8217;s no issue set at all that I believe we find anything other than the certainty that a commitment that &#8212; between the United States and Germany doesn&#8217;t benefit whatever the problem or the concern is.<br>&nbsp;<br>We need to fight COVID-19 pandemic everywhere, to strengthen global health security for tomorrow so we&#8217;re ready for the next pandemic.<br>&nbsp;<br>We need to make sure that the rules of the road governing the use of emerging technologies advance freedom, not authoritarianism and repression.<br>&nbsp;<br>And we need to promote a sustainable and inclusive economic recovery that enhances the prosperity and opportunity for all.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so much more.<br>&nbsp;<br>This just &#8212; this isn&#8217;t just the work of governments, the work is the work of our peoples, sharing their innovation and insights, joining together to amplify our collective impact.<br>&nbsp;<br>So today, we&#8217;re launching a Futures Forum between our two countries, which will bring together top experts across business, academia, civil society, and more to collaborate as we shape our shared future.<br>&nbsp;<br>Madam Chancellor, I know that the partnership between Germany and United States will continue to grow stronger on the foundation that you have helped to build. But on a personal note, I must tell you, I&#8217;ll miss seeing you at our summits. I truly will.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, thank you again, Angela, for making the journey, for our productive meeting today, and for your friendship.<br>&nbsp;<br>CHANCELLOR MERKEL: (As interpreted.) Mr. President, dear Joe, first of all, I would like to thank you most warmly for the condolences and the empathy you expressed as regards the victims to the floodings in Germany.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I would like to ask for your understanding that I need to address this matter with a few words because, in North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate, the day is already drawing to a close &#8212; a day that is characterized by fear, by despair, by suffering. And hundreds of thousands of people, all of a sudden, were faced with catastrophe. Their houses were literally death traps. Small rivers turned into flooded, devastating rivers.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I must say that my empathy and my heart goes out to all of those who, in this catastrophe, lost their loved ones or who are still worrying about the fate of people still missing.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I include Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands who’ve also suffered from floodings.<br>&nbsp;<br>The rescuers, first responders are doing their utmost to help people. I must say that I&#8217;m very much feeling with those who&#8217;ve suffered, and I know that millions of people in Germany feel the same.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Minister-Presidents Ms. Dreyer and Mr. Laschet, Minister-Presidents of Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia, respectively, and also the ministers who were responsible here &#8212; I talked to them, and I would like to send out a message to the people that we will not leave them alone with their suffering and that we&#8217;re trying our utmost to help them in their distress.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mr. President, dear Joe, thank you for the invitation. Thank you for making it possible to talk to you. It&#8217;s my first visit since 2019, and I&#8217;m so much &#8212; so happy about the personal exchange we have seen again today that we&#8217;re not only partners and allies, but we&#8217;re very close friends. And thank you for the very friendly exchange that we had this afternoon.<br>&nbsp;<br>We all share the same values. We all share the same determination to tackle the challenges of our times, to master them. And I&#8217;m deeply convinced that simply committing to these values is certainly not sufficient. We are living at a crucial moment in time where we are facing new challenges, and these challenges need to be translated into practical policies.<br>&nbsp;<br>So I&#8217;m very grateful that we have this opportunity to work on foundations. And we lay down those foundations in the Washington Declaration, and also how we see the road ahead, and also measures. And I think that this Futures Forum will deal with those issues. Our societies will discuss together what sort of solutions they think appropriate, and I think such structures are very important.<br>&nbsp;<br>There is a very large degree of common ground, as has come out of our talks. We are convinced, both of us, that overcoming this pandemic is only possible if as many people as possible are vaccinated in our countries, and many wish to do that.<br>&nbsp;<br>We have to also support the rest of the world with vaccines. We work together with COVAX. And I&#8217;m very grateful to the United States that, under your leadership, dear Joe, the U.S. has committed itself very clearly and unequivocally to multilateralism, be it on climate, be it on reform of the World Health Organization, and support also to WTO.<br>&nbsp;<br>Germany and the United States have agreed to provide vaccine doses to poorer countries; we work within COVAX, as I said.<br>&nbsp;<br>We talked about the challenge of climate change. And I am very happy that the United States are now back again with us in the Paris Climate Agreement and for Glasgow. That provides us with a totally different basis in order to work among the parties to the treaty better &#8212; in a much better and much more efficient way for climate.<br>&nbsp;<br>And we see countries that are (inaudible) by floodings, by wildfires, and by storms in an increasing manner, and that shows that there is a dramatic increase in such unusual weather phenomena and we have to contend with this.<br>&nbsp;<br>Germany and the United States have now forged an Energy and Climate Partnership. I think it&#8217;s a very important message that we&#8217;re sending here. We want to build on future-oriented technologies &#8212; green hydrogen, for example; renewables; electromobility. We&#8217;re in competition with others on this planet, and we would like to be successful together. And Germany is very much looking forward to cooperating in this respect.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I support the President in what he proposed as a global infrastructure project, which we agreed on on the G7 summit. Next year, as you probably know, we will have the chairmanship of the &#8212; the presidency of the G7, and we will bring this project forward.<br>&nbsp;<br>We talked about Russia and Ukraine and, in this context, also about Nord Stream 2. We&#8217;ve come to different assessments as to what this project entails. But let me say very clearly: Our idea is and remains that Ukraine remains a transit country for natural gas; that Ukraine, just as any other country in the world, has a right to territorial sovereignty, which is why we&#8217;ve become engaged and continue to be engaged in the Minsk Process.<br>&nbsp;<br>We will be actively acting should Russia not respect this right of Ukraine that it has as a transit country. So Nord Stream 2 is an additional project and certainly not a project to replace any kind of transit through Ukraine. Anything else would obviously create a lot of tension. And we&#8217;re also talking about how we can actually make this very clear together.<br>&nbsp;<br>We also talked about other priorities in our foreign policy. For example, our relationship with China. We are countries who stand up for free, democratic societies &#8212; stand up for those rights &#8212; civic rights for those who live in these societies. So, wherever human rights are not guaranteed, we will make our voices heard and make clear that we don&#8217;t agree with this. We are also for territorial integrity of all countries of the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>We also talked about the many facets of cooperation and also of competition with China, be it in the economic area, be it on climate protection, be it in the military sector and on security.<br>&nbsp;<br>And, obviously, there are a lot of challenges ahead. On the nuclear agreement with Iran, JCPOA &#8212; we think that everything ought to be done in order to bring this to a successful conclusion. But I think that is something that is also &#8212; the ball very much here is also in the Iranian camp.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now, over many, many years, we&#8217;ve served together in Afghanistan. We&#8217;ve been able to contain, to a certain degree, terrorist dangers. But, unfortunately, we have not been able to build a nation as we would like it to look.<br>&nbsp;<br>And, still, I would hold, it was a good partnership &#8212; has been a good partnership with the United States all throughout this experience. Also very good contacts between our soldiers. I know our soldiers greatly appreciated that.<br>&nbsp;<br>We also talked about Sahel &#8212; the Sahel zone where terrorism is on the rampage. And obviously, for us in Europe, this is a great challenge. We&#8217;re very &#8212; and also for the countries on the ground &#8212; we’re very grateful to the United States for their mission in order to contain and push back against these terrorist advances.<br>&nbsp;<br>We also have drawn up a German &#8212; we&#8217;ve also agreed on a German-American dialogue between our business communities, because we have considerable trade links and we wish to build on this. And obviously, the economy and economic ties are of prime importance.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, it was a very, very good exchange. We&#8217;re close partners. I would like this to remain even after I have left office. And I think, with this visit, we probably paved the way to make it possible to also create formats where we can exchange, because the world will continue to be a place that is full of challenges.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, thank you very much for making it possible for us to tackle those together. Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>PRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you very much. We&#8217;re each going to take two questions. And I&#8217;m going to begin by recognizing Steve Portnoy and congratulate you on your new role as president of the White House Correspondents Association.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; Thank you, sir.<br>&nbsp;<br>PRESIDENT BIDEN: My sympathies.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; (Laughs.)<br>&nbsp;<br>PRESIDENT BIDEN: No, but thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; I appreciate that, sir. On behalf of the press corps, thank you, and we&#8217;re looking forward to the day we can have even more reporters all the way to the back of the room. So, thank you very much.<br>&nbsp;<br>PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Laughs.)<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; I have a couple of questions for you. Also a question for the Chancellor. But, Mr. President, with respect to Latin America and the developments there in the last week-plus &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>PRESIDENT BIDEN: Yes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; &#8212; what are the circumstances under which you would send American troops to Haiti? That&#8217;s the first question.<br>&nbsp;<br>The second question is: When it comes to Cuba, what is your current thinking on American sanctions toward Cuba and the embargo? And today, your Press Secretary said that communism is a “failed ideology.” I assume that&#8217;s your view. I was wondering if you could also give us your view on socialism.<br>&nbsp;<br>And then, for the Chancellor, the question is: Madam, the President said that you know the Oval Office as well as he does. I&#8217;m wondering if you could reflect on your exchanges with American Presidents over the last 16 years and, particularly, contrast the current President with his most immediate predecessor.<br>&nbsp;<br>PRESIDENT BIDEN: In two minutes or less. (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>Obviously, I know why they elected you president. (Laughter.) Well, let me start off by answering the question relative to Haiti and Cuba. And communism is a failed system &#8212; a universally failed system. And I don&#8217;t see socialism as a very useful substitute, but that&#8217;s another story.<br>&nbsp;<br>With regard to whether the circumstances in which we would send military troops to Haiti: We &#8212; we’re only sending American Marines to our embassy to make sure that they are secure and nothing is out of whack at all. But the idea of sending American forces into Haiti is not on the agenda at this moment, number one.<br>&nbsp;<br>Number two, with regard to Cuba: Cuba is a &#8212; unfortunately, a failed state and repressing their citizens. There are a number of things that we would consider doing to help the people of Cuba, but it would require a different circumstance or a guarantee that they would not be taken advantage of by the government &#8212; for example, the ability to send remittances to &#8212; back to Cuba. I would not do that now because the fact is it’s highly likely that the regime would confiscate those remittances or big chunks of it.<br>&nbsp;<br>With regard to the need COVID on &#8212; I mean &#8212; excuse me &#8212; they have a COVID problem on &#8212; in Cuba. I&#8217;d be prepared to give significant amounts of vaccine if, in fact, I was assured an international organization would administer those vaccines and do it in a way that average citizens would have access to those vaccines.<br>&nbsp;<br>And one of the things that you did not ask but we&#8217;re considering is &#8212; they&#8217;ve cut off access to the Internet. We&#8217;re considering whether we have the technological ability to reinstate that access.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I think I&#8217;ve answered your questions. Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>CHANCELLOR MERKEL: (As interpreted.) Allow me, if I may, to elaborate on three different points. Any German chancellor has a vested interest to talk &#8212; and that’s in &#8212; very much in the vested interest of Germany to work and talk together with any American President.<br>&nbsp;<br>We’ve always had contacts, and we &#8212; you’ve been able to &#8212; it was, I think, very transparent, and today it was a very friendly exchange.<br>&nbsp;<br>Oh, sorry. I have to call on Mr. Kynast and his German question.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; (As interpreted.) Thank you very much, Madam Chancellor, Mr. President. Allow me, if I may, to ask a question as regards Nord Stream 2. Madam Chancellor, you just said that you would act actively should Russia be in breach of its commitments &#8212; so, for example, interrupt gas transit through Ukraine. What do you mean in concrete terms? Will Germany then switch off Nord Stream 2 from the German side? And what sort of legal grounds would you be, sort of, claiming?<br>&nbsp;<br>Mr. President, you have fought so many years &#8212; the U.S. has fought so many years against Nord Stream 2. Now, there will be only a few days left until this pipeline comes into operation. Why &#8212; will you allow it to go ahead, to put it in operation, or will the people who operate the system actually have to contend with sanctions on the horizon?<br>&nbsp;<br>CHANCELLOR MERKEL: Well, Mr. Kynast, as the Chancellor, you know that we&#8217;ve worked a lot &#8212; not only Germany incidentally, but the whole of the European Commission &#8212; for talking to Russia and Ukraine, negotiating a treaty that ensures until 2023 the gas contract and, after that, gas deliveries must be possible as well. That is what I&#8217;ve heard at least. Let me be very careful here in my wording.<br>&nbsp;<br>And then should that not go ahead, we have a number of instruments at our disposal, which are not necessarily on the German side, but on the European side. For example, sanctions and as regards Crimea and breach of the Minsk treaty has shown that we have these sanctions &#8212; these instruments at our disposal.<br>&nbsp;<br>We have possibilities to react. We are in contact with our European friends on this. But at the &#8212; at the point in time of which I hope we will never have to take those decisions, you will then see what we do.<br>&nbsp;<br>PRESIDENT BIDEN: My view on Nord Stream 2 has been known for some time. Good friends can disagree. And &#8212; but by the time I became President, it was 90 percent completed. And imposing sanctions did not seem to make any sense. It made more sense to work with the Chancellor on finding out how she’d proceed based on whether or not Russia tried to, essentially, blackmail Ukraine in some way.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, the Chancellor and I have asked our teams to look at practical measures we could take together, and whether or not Europe energy security, Ukraine security are actually strengthened or weakened based on Russian actions. And so this is a &#8212; we&#8217;ll see. We&#8217;ll see.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ms. Leonard of Bloomberg.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions for you, and then some for Chancellor Merkel as well. Your administration, tomorrow, is issuing a business advisory for Hong Kong. I was wondering if you can explain why you think that is necessary.<br>&nbsp;<br>And then, secondly, on your Build Back Better agenda, have you spoken to Senators Manchin and Sinema about the $3.5 trillion framework, and are you confident that they&#8217;ll be on board at that level? And if they demand that you lose some components, will you be able to keep progressives on board?<br>&nbsp;<br>(As interpreted.) I wanted to ask you whether you have a feeling that, after the talk with President Biden, he better understands your viewpoint as regards to China or whether the situation is still tense, whether there is still decoupling. And secondly, whether you think that the United States has contributed enough to vaccinate the rest of the world, or do you think it’s only &#8212; is it appropriate for children in the United States being vaccinated &#8212; children below the age of 12, while adults in other countries have no chance to get vaccinated?<br>&nbsp;<br>PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s all? (Laughter.) I thought I said we’d take two questions, but I guess that translated to we&#8217;d take two questions or more from each person called on.<br>&nbsp;<br>Let me talk about the business advisory. The situation in Hong Kong is deteriorating. And the Chinese government is not keeping its commitment that it made how it would deal with &#8212; with Hong Kong.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so it is more of an advisory as to what may happen in &#8212; on Hong Kong. It&#8217;s as simple as that and as complicated as that.<br>&nbsp;<br>With regard to “Am I confident?” &#8212; I&#8217;m supremely confident that everything is going to work out perfectly in terms &#8212; (laughs) &#8212; look, I understand why the press, among others, is skeptical that I can actually get this deal done on infrastructure and on human infrastructure. And I&#8217;ve watched and listened, and the press declared my initiative dead at least 10 times so far.<br>&nbsp;<br>I don&#8217;t think it’s dead. I think it’s still alive. I still have confidence we&#8217;re going to be able to get what I proposed and what I&#8217;ve agreed to in the bipartisan agreement on infrastructure.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;ve gotten &#8212; we&#8217;ve each committed &#8212; I trust the members of &#8212; the Republican senators who have made the commitments relative to how we should proceed and what would be included in the package for infrastructure. And they’re men and women of honor, and I expect they would keep their commitment.<br>&nbsp;<br>With regard to the further issue of what&#8217;s going on and what will confuse the listening audience &#8212; but reconciliation &#8212; that is the mechanism by which you have to get every single Democrat to agree to proceed on matters like what I announced today.<br>&nbsp;<br>Today &#8212; I don&#8217;t know whether you have any children; it&#8217;s none of my business whether you do, but if you do, you&#8217;re going to get &#8212; if you&#8217;re making less than $150,000 &#8212; you&#8217;re going to get a significant stipend that is a tax cut. If you have a child under the age of seven years old, you&#8217;re going to get &#8212; in your bank account today, you&#8217;re going to get a payment of one &#8212; 12 months divided &#8212; $3,600 &#8212; $3,700 for that child divided by 12 every month, just like a Social Security check.<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s expected to reduce pov- &#8212; child poverty by over 40 percent. And it could be a significant, significant game-changer.<br>&nbsp;<br>We have mechanisms to pay for both these mechanisms. And there may be some last-minute discussion as to who &#8212; what mechanism is used to pay for each of these items, both the infrastructure package and the human infrastructure package. But I believe we will get it done. Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>CHANCELLOR MERKEL: (As interpreted.) We talked about China, and there is a lot of common understanding that China, in many areas, is our competitor; that trade with China needs to rest on the assumption that we have a level playing field so that we all play by the same rules, have the same standards. That, incidentally, was also the driving force behind the EU-China Agreement on trade that they abide by the core labor norms of ILO.<br>&nbsp;<br>And we are convinced of our needing to be technological leaders for our two countries in many, many areas. Obviously, it&#8217;s legitimate for China wishing to do this as well, but, for example, we will cooperate in many technological state-of-the-art technologies &#8212; for example, CHIPS. I think the act that the President launched is fundamental in this respect and crucial.<br>&nbsp;<br>And we want to trade together at a time of digitalization where security issues loom very large in our agenda &#8212; as we ought to have an exchange on this; we ought to talk about this; we ought to talk about norms, standards that govern the Internet; whether we can agree on common norms. I think, particularly as regards to the relationship of us with China, we ought to coordinate our efforts. We do that in the European Union, and we should do it with the United States.<br>&nbsp;<br>And then there are interests, obviously &#8212; sometimes divergent interests, but sometimes common interests. But we also have, obviously, areas where American companies compete with European companies, and we have to accept that. But I think, basically, the rules as to how we deal with China ought to rest and do rest on our shared values.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I think, on the pandemic, we are obviously of the opinion that the pandemic &#8212; we can only master the pandemic if each and every one is vaccinated. We are trying to boost production. We are trying also to get as many people in our country vaccinated as possible &#8212; which obviously opens us up to criticism of those countries who has yet have not had the chance, which is why we invested a lot of money in COVAX, which is why we encourage our companies to increase their production of vaccines.<br>&nbsp;<br>And, in Africa, we are trying to help Africans to upskill people so that they, too, can have their own production sites. We&#8217;re going to do this, but, de facto, there is an imbalance; I agree.<br>&nbsp;<br>And &#8212; but we&#8217;re overcoming. We&#8217;re putting our all into that and also together in overcoming that imbalance.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;m sorry. I call on Ms. Schaeuble from Der Tagesspiegel newspaper. Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp; Very short one for each of you. Mr. President, my question &#8212; my first question touches an issue that worries a lot of people in the U.S. and in Germany. Can you explain to us why there still is a travel ban for people coming from Germany or other states of the European Union, while people from Turkey, where the number of new cases are seven times as high, can come?<br>&nbsp;<br>You all have repeatedly said that you&#8217;re following scientific data. What is the main argument for not lifting that travel ban for the Schengen region?<br>&nbsp;<br>And, Chancellor Merkel &#8212; (as interpreted) &#8212; you talked to the business companies here. You heard their concerns. You heard their headaches. Some have threatened that they&#8217;re going to shift business away from the United States. What was your main argument to work for a lifting of the travel ban? And have you had success with this?<br>&nbsp;<br>PRESIDENT BIDEN: We brought in the head of our &#8212; our COVID team because the Chancellor brought that subject up. It’s in the process of (inaudible) how soon we can lift the ban &#8212; it&#8217;s in process now. &nbsp;And I&#8217;ll be able to answer that question to you within the next several days &#8212; what is likely to happen. I&#8217;m waiting to hear from our folks in our &#8212; our COVID team as to when that should be done. And the Chancellor did raise it. (Laughs.)<br>&nbsp;<br>CHANCELLOR MERKEL: (As interpreted.) I did raise the issue, yes, and got the same answer that the President gave you just now. The COVID team is evaluating the matter. We had an exchange on &#8212; in both areas.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Delta variant actually being on the increase, that is, again, a new challenge to both of us. And obviously, before such a decision, one has to reflect, and it has to be a sustainable decision. It is certainly not sensible to have to take it back after only a few days. So I&#8217;m &#8212; have every confidence in the American COVID team.<br>&nbsp;<br>PRESIDENT BIDEN: Having been here many times, if we don&#8217;t leave right now, we&#8217;re going to miss dinner. Chancellor and I have a dinner with some &#8212; a number of folks, and very shortly.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, thank you for your attention. And thank you for your &#8212; for your questions. Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>CHANCELLOR MERKEL: Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>5:49 P.M. EDT</p>
