										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, we learned that our private sector has recovered all of the jobs lost during the pandemic, and added jobs on top of that. This has been the fastest and strongest jobs recovery in American history, and it would not have been possible without the decisive action my Administration took last year to fix a broken COVID response, and pass the American Rescue Plan to get our economy back on track.</p>



<p>In the second quarter of this year, we created more jobs than in any quarter under any of my predecessors in the nearly 40 years before the pandemic. We have more Americans working in the private sector today than any day during Donald Trump’s Presidency – more people than any time in our history.</p>



<p>The historic strength of our job market is one reason our economy is uniquely well positioned to tackle a range of global economic challenges – from global inflation to the economic fallout from Putin’s war. No country is better positioned than America to bring down inflation, without giving up all of the economic gains we have made over the last 18 months.</p>



<p>Of course, having added a record number of new jobs, and achieved historically low levels of unemployment, additional job growth from this strong position will be slower. That is not a bad thing, because our economy should move to stable growth for the years ahead.</p>



<p>The best way to achieve that goal is for Congress to pass legislation that lowers costs for families – from prescription drugs to utility costs – while reducing the federal budget deficit, in addition to passing the Bipartisan Innovation Act.</p>

<p>I am stunned, outraged, and deeply saddened by the news that my friend Abe Shinzo, former Prime Minister of Japan, was shot and killed while campaigning. This is a tragedy for Japan and for all who knew him. I had the privilege to work closely with Prime Minister Abe. As Vice President, I visited him in Tokyo and welcomed him to Washington. He was a champion of the Alliance between our nations and the friendship between our people. The longest serving Japanese Prime Minister, his vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific will endure. Above all, he cared deeply about the Japanese people and dedicated his life to their service. Even at the moment he was attacked, he was engaged in the work of democracy. While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief. I send my deepest condolences to his family. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Two weeks ago, the Supreme Court issued a decision that overturned <em>Roe v. Wade </em>and eliminated a woman’s Constitutional right to choose.&nbsp; This decision expressly took away a right from the American people that it had recognized for nearly 50 years – a woman’s right to make her own reproductive health care decisions, free from government interference.&nbsp; Fundamental rights – to privacy, autonomy, freedom, and equality – have been denied to millions of women across the country, with grave implications for their health, lives, and wellbeing. This ruling will disproportionately affect women of color, low-income women, and rural women.<br><br>President Biden has made clear that the only way to secure a woman’s right to choose is for Congress to restore the protections of&nbsp;<em>Roe</em>&nbsp;as federal law. Until then, he has committed to doing everything in his power to defend reproductive rights and protect access to safe and legal abortion.<br><br>Today, President Biden will sign an Executive Order Protecting Access to Reproductive Health Care Services. This Executive Order builds on the actions his Administration has already taken to defend reproductive rights by:</p>



<ul><li>Safeguarding access to reproductive health care services, including abortion and contraception;<br></li><li>Protecting the privacy of patients and their access to accurate information;<br></li><li>Promoting the safety and security of patients, providers, and clinics; and<br></li><li>Coordinating the implementation of Federal efforts to protect reproductive rights and access to health care.</li></ul>



<p><strong>SAFEGUARDING ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES</strong><br><br>The President has directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to take the following actions and submit a report to him within 30 days on efforts to:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Protect Access to Medication Abortion.</strong>&nbsp; HHS will take additional action to protect and expand access to abortion care, including access to medication that the FDA approved as safe and effective over twenty years ago. These actions will build on the steps the Secretary of HHS has already taken at the President’s direction following the decision to ensure that medication abortion is as widely accessible as possible.<br></li><li><strong>Ensure Emergency Medical Care.</strong>&nbsp; HHS will take steps to ensure all patients – including pregnant women and those experiencing pregnancy loss – have access to the full rights and protections for emergency medical care afforded under the law, including by considering updates to current guidance that clarify physician responsibilities and protections under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA).&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Protect Access to Contraception.</strong>&nbsp; HHS will take additional actions to expand access to the full range of reproductive health services, including family planning services and providers, such as access to emergency contraception and long-acting reversible contraception like intrauterine devices (IUDs). &nbsp;In all fifty states and the District of Columbia, the Affordable Care Act guarantees coverage of women’s preventive services, including free birth control and contraceptive counseling, for individuals and covered dependents. The Secretary of HHS has already directed the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to take every legally available step to ensure patient access to family planning care and to protect family planning providers.<br></li><li><strong>Launch Outreach and Public Education Efforts.&nbsp; </strong>HHS will increase outreach and public education efforts regarding access to reproductive health care services—including abortion—to ensure that Americans have access to reliable and accurate information about their rights and access to care.<br></li><li><strong>Convene Volunteer Lawyers.</strong>&nbsp; The Attorney General and the White House Counsel will convene private pro bono attorneys, bar associations, and public interest organizations to encourage robust legal representation of patients, providers, and third parties lawfully seeking or offering reproductive health care services throughout the country.&nbsp; Such representation could include protecting the right to travel out of state to seek medical care. Immediately following the Supreme Court decision, the President announced his Administration’s position that Americans must remain free to travel safely to another state to seek the care they need, as <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-statement-supreme-court-ruling-dobbs-v-jackson-women-s">the Attorney General made clear in his statement</a>, and his commitment to fighting any attack by a state or local official who attempts to interfere with women exercising this right.</li></ul>



<p><strong>PROTECTING PATIENT PRIVACY AND ACCESS TO ACCURATE INFORMATION</strong><br><br>The President’s Executive Order takes additional steps to protect patient privacy, including by addressing the transfer and sales of sensitive health-related data, combatting digital surveillance related to reproductive health care services, and protecting people seeking reproductive health care from inaccurate information, fraudulent schemes, or deceptive practices.&nbsp; The Executive Order will:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Protect Consumers from Privacy Violations and Fraudulent and Deceptive Practices.</strong>&nbsp; The President has asked the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission to consider taking steps to protect consumers’ privacy when seeking information about and provision of reproductive health care services.&nbsp; The President also has directed the Secretary of HHS, in consultation with the Attorney General and Chair of the FTC, to consider options to address deceptive or fraudulent practices, including online, and protect access to accurate information.</li><li><strong>Protect Sensitive Health Information.</strong>&nbsp; HHS will consider additional actions, including under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), to better protect sensitive information related to reproductive health care. The Secretary of HHS has already directed the HHS Office for Civil Rights to take initial steps to ensure patient privacy and nondiscrimination of patients, as well as providers who provide reproductive health care, including by:<br><ul><li>Issuing <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/phi-reproductive-health/index.html">new guidance</a> to address how the HIPAA Privacy Rule protects the privacy of individuals’ protected health information, including information related to reproductive health care. The guidance helps ensure doctors and other medical providers and health plans know that, with limited exceptions, they are not required – and in many cases, are not permitted – to disclose patients’ private information, including to law enforcement.&nbsp;<br></li><li>Issuing <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/cell-phone-hipaa/index.html">a how-to guide</a> for consumers on steps they can take to make sure they’re protecting their personal data on mobile apps.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p><strong>PROMOTING SAFETY AND SECURITY</strong><br><br>The Executive Order addresses the heightened risk related to seeking and providing reproductive health care and will:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Protect Patients, Providers, and Clinics.</strong>&nbsp; The Administration will ensure the safety of patients, providers, and third parties, and to protect the security of other entities that are providing, dispensing, or delivering reproductive health care services.&nbsp; This charge includes efforts to protect mobile clinics, which have been deployed to borders to offer care for out-of-state patients.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>COORDINATING IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS</strong><br><br>To ensure the Federal government takes a swift and coordinated approach to addressing reproductive rights and protecting access to reproductive health care, the President’s Executive Order will:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Establish an Interagency Task Force.</strong>&nbsp; The President has directed HHS and the White House Gender Policy Council to establish and lead an interagency Task Force on Reproductive Health Care Access, responsible for coordinating Federal interagency policymaking and program development.&nbsp; This Task Force will also include the Attorney General.&nbsp; In addition, the Attorney General will provide technical assistance to states affording legal protection to out-of-state patients as well as providers who offer legal reproductive health care.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>EXECUTIVE ORDER BUILDS ON ADMINISTRATION’S ACTIONS TO PROTECT ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE</strong><br><br>In addition to the actions announced today, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken the following steps to protect access to reproductive health care and defend reproductive rights in the wake of the Supreme Court decision in <em>Dobbs</em>.&nbsp; On the day of the decision, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/06/24/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-supreme-court-decision-to-overturn-roe-v-wade/">the President strongly denounced the decision</a> as an affront to women’s fundamental rights and the right to choose In addition to action mentioned above, the Biden-Harris Administration is:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Supporting Providers and Clinics.&nbsp; </strong>The Secretary of HHS directed all HHS agencies to ensure that all HHS-funded providers and clinics have appropriate training and resources to handle family planning needs, and <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/06/30/hhs-announces-new-grants-to-bolster-family-planner-provider-training.html">announced nearly $3 million in new funding</a> to bolster training and technical assistance for the nationwide network of Title X family planning providers.<br></li><li><strong>Promoting Access to Accurate Information.</strong>&nbsp; On the day of the Supreme Court’s decision, HHS launched <a href="https://reproductiverights.gov/">ReproductiveRights.gov</a>, which provides timely and accurate information about reproductive rights and access to reproductive health care.&nbsp; This includes know-your-rights information for patients and providers and promoting awareness of and access to family planning services, as well as guidance for <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/complaints/index.html">how to file a patient privacy or nondiscrimination complaint</a> with its Office for Civil Rights.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Providing Leave</strong><strong> for Federal Workers Traveling for Medical Care.&nbsp; </strong>The Office of Personnel Management <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/sick-leave-faqs.pdf">issued guidance</a> affirming that paid sick leave can be taken to cover absences for travel to obtain reproductive health care.<br></li><li><strong>Protecting Access to Reproductive Health Care Services for Service members, DoD Civilians, and Military Families.</strong>&nbsp; The Department of Defense (DoD) issued a memo to the Force, DoD civilians and military families on ensuring access to essential women’s health care services. The memo reiterates that the Department will continue to provide seamless access to reproductive healthcare for military and civilian patients, as permitted by federal law.&nbsp; Military providers will continue to fulfill their duty to care for Service members, military dependents and civilian personnel who require pregnancy termination in the cases of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother.</li></ul>

<p><em>Projects will increase airport capacity, energy efficiency and accessibility</em></p>



<p><em>Funding going to communities small, medium and large across country</em></p>



<p><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> – The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will award nearly $1 billion from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding to 85 airports across the country to improve terminals of all sizes. The grants expand capacity at our nation’s airport terminals, increase energy efficiency, promote competition and provide greater accessibility for individuals with disabilities. Building better airport terminals will improve customer experiences, move goods through the economy more efficiently to lower prices and enhance U.S. competitiveness.</p>



<p>Two grants will also be awarded to build and improve new air traffic control towers.</p>



<p>“Americans deserve modern airports that meet the needs of their families and growing passenger demand. Funded through President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, today’s grants will improve airport terminals while also creating good jobs in communities across the country,”<strong> said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.</strong></p>



<p>View a <a href="https://www.faa.gov/bil/airport-terminals">data visualization of the airports</a> receiving grants and how the funds will be invested.</p>



<p>“The work that goes in to build safer, more accessible and sustainable terminals will provide opportunities for people across the nation. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a critical investment not only in our nation’s infrastructure, but an investment in the future of our country’s workforce,” <strong>said FAA Deputy Administrator A. Bradley Mims.</strong></p>



<p>Historically, the FAA has invested in runways, traffic-control towers and back-of-house infrastructure. Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, there is dedicated funding to support modernizing airport terminals across the country.</p>



<p>70 grants contain an element that will <strong><u>expand terminal capacity</u></strong>. Among them are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Pittsburgh International Airport (Pittsburgh, Pa.)</strong>: $20 million to construct a new 700,000-square-foot landside terminal adjacent to the existing airside terminal and includes an improved passenger security screening checkpoint and checked baggage inspection system, baggage handling equipment, U.S. Customs and Border Protection area, and associated public spaces and support functions to serve passengers and meet the operational needs of the airport.</li><li><strong>Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport (Chattanooga, Tenn.): </strong>$5 million for phase one of a terminal expansion project that will expand its second level by nearly 27,000 square feet to allow for two new gates, one expanded gate, a new set of restrooms, and additional passenger queuing, hold room and circulation space. This phase will also reorient the TSA Checkpoint to allow for an additional screening lane and expand the terminal rotunda sufficient to provide adequate passenger queuing space. The project will increase terminal capacity, improve ADA accessibility, increase energy efficiency, promote airline competition, and create jobs.</li><li><strong>Huntsville Intl-Carl T Jones Field (Huntsville, Ala.)</strong>: $10 million to replace aging elevators, escalators, and mechanical equipment; adding one elevator and three escalators; constructing new terminal and concourse restrooms, family restrooms, nursing rooms, and a Service Animal Relief Area; expanding terminal public areas; and ticket counter modifications. The project will provide more amenities for passengers, increase capacity, achieve ADA compliance, improve energy efficiency, improve accessibility, and create construction jobs.</li><li><strong>Orlando International Airport (Orlando, Fla.):</strong> $50 million to construct four gates capable of serving either four wide body or eight narrow body aircraft. The project increases capacity, provides ADA-compliant facilities, achieves LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification and provides for increased competition.</li></ul>



<p>76 grants contain an element that will <strong><u>increase terminal sustainability</u></strong>. Among them are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (Texas)</strong>: $35 million to construct a zero-carbon electrical central utility plant to assist the airport in achieving its goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2030. Phase 1 will construct the facility and cover two of five terminals.</li><li><strong>Boise Airport (Boise, Ida.):</strong> $960,000 to install energy efficient boilers to support Boise&#8217;s clean energy goal. The funds will also be used to replace aging skylight infrastructure with new skylights that will be more energy efficient.</li><li><strong>Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Seattle, Wash.):</strong> $10 million for Phase 3 of a restroom modernization that will be ADA compliant and include energy efficient lighting, low flow fixtures and refillable water bottle stations and service animal relief areas.</li><li><strong>Bishop International Airport (Flint, Mich.):</strong> $3.5 million to replace the terminal roof, which has failed in many places. It will be replaced with energy efficient materials, including improved insulation. This will result in decreased heating and cooling needs and reduce energy consumption.</li></ul>



<p>47 grants contain an element that will go <strong>to improving airport access to historically disadvantaged populations and rural airports.</strong> Among them are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Dexter Regional Airport (Dexter, Maine)</strong>: $760,000 to build a new 800 square foot terminal building replacing the existing 50-year-old 200 square foot terminal building. It includes the reconstruction of the access road. The existing terminal building is beyond its useful life and does not meet current standards or needs for a basic general aviation terminal building. It does not meet ADA requirements and energy efficiencies. The new terminal building will enhance and meet all these needs and requirements. This project provides access to improved terminal facilities for a disadvantage population area in this rural part of Maine.</li><li><strong>Washington Municipal Airport (AWG) Washington, Iowa</strong>: $129,675 to install a solar power system and associated electrical efficiency enhancements for the general aviation terminal.</li><li><strong>Chamberlain Municipal Airport (Chamberlain, S.D.):</strong> $855,000 to construct a new general aviation terminal. This project will replace an existing annex to a Fixed Base Operator (FBO) building that is currently being used as a general aviation terminal. The existing facility does not meet ADA requirement and does not meet the needs of the airport.</li><li><strong>Fillmore County Airport (Preston, Minn.):</strong> $950,000 to replace an existing facility that was constructed in the 1981 that is in poor condition and does not meet ADA requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>73 grants contain an element that <strong><u>provide greater access to individuals with disabilities</u></strong>. Among them are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport (Phoenix, Az.):</strong> $14.4 million to expand and update existing temporary terminal space with a permanent five-gate ADA compliant facility.</li><li><strong>Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (Minneapolis, Minn.):</strong> $7.1 million to replace five passenger boarding bridges and relocate one passenger boarding bridge. This project will modify walkways, ramps, and slopes to better utilize space and meet ADA requirements. The new boarding bridges will also be more energy efficient.</li><li><strong>Austin Bergstrom International Airport (Austin, Texas)</strong>: $15 million to complete Phase 2, which includes needed capacity expansion immediately and infill for future expansion for the medium hub on the cusp of large hub. In addition to capacity, the project improves access with hearing loops, wayfinding, and multi-lingual assistance, plus assistive care restrooms and ADA compliance throughout. LEED Silver goal projects include energy efficient systems, glass tinting, and sustainable energy construction.</li></ul>



<p>Two grants are awarded to airports to <strong><u>build new air traffic control towers</u></strong>. Those airports are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>General Wayne A. Downing Peoria International Airport (Peoria, Ill.)</strong>: $15 million to construct a new air traffic control tower. The existing tower is 63 years old, in poor condition, and does not meet ADA standards. The new tower will meet all current building codes including ADA, and will utilize modern, energy efficient HVAC systems and lighting.</li><li><strong>Asheville Regional Airport (Asheville, N</strong><strong>.C.):</strong> $15 million to construct a new air traffic control tower. This project replaces an existing 61-year-old air traffic control tower with a new, expanded facility. It is also an enabling project for the expansion and renovation of the existing terminal building. The project will enable increased terminal capacity, replace aging and obsolete infrastructure, improve airfield safety, upgrade the facility to ADA standards, and increase energy efficiency.</li></ul>



<p>One grant will increase <strong><u>multimodal transportation access</u></strong>. That grant goes to:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Gainesville Regional Airport (Gainesville, Fla.):</strong> $1.67 million to improve a multi-modal ground transport facility. This project consists of multi-modal ground transport facility improvements, including lighted, accessible, covered walkways to the commercial airline terminal, a covered passenger waiting area, accessible restrooms, and queuing lanes for taxis and city busses arriving and departing the terminal. The project will reduce curbside congestion, increase ADA accessibility, improve accessibility for historically disadvantaged populations, and provide construction jobs.</li></ul>



<p>Today’s funding is from the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/bil/airport-terminals">Airport Terminal Program</a>, one of three aviation programs created by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The law provides $1 billion annually for five years for Airport Terminal grants. Learn more at <a href="http://www.faa.gov/bil">faa.gov/bil</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/bipartisan-infrastructure-law/">President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law</a>, also known as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, makes a historic investment in our nation’s infrastructure and competitiveness. It will rebuild America’s roads, bridges and rails, upgrade and expand public transit, modernize the nation’s ports and airports, improve safety, tackle the climate crisis, advance environmental justice and invest in communities that have too often been left behind. It will drive the creation of good-paying union jobs and grow the economy sustainably and equitably to help everyone get ahead for decades to come.</p>

<p>Well, let me start off by saying &#8212; I’d get in trouble with my mother, were she here, if I didn’t say, “Excuse my back when I’m speaking.”&nbsp; I apologize.&nbsp; Number one.</p>



<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; (Inaudible.)</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; You have my &#8212; (laughs) &#8212;</p>



<p>Hello, Cleveland!&nbsp; Before I begin, though, I want to make one serious comment about the shooting and the death of Jayland Walker.&nbsp; The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division; the FBI Field Office in Akron, Ohio; and the local U.S. Attorney’s Office are closely monitoring and reviewing what happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FBI continues to coordinate with state and local partners to provide resources and specialized skill.&nbsp; If the evidence reveals potential violations of federal criminal statutes, the Justice Department will take the appropriate action.&nbsp; And I just want you to know what’s going to happen.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And now &#8212; now for today’s program.&nbsp; Thank you, Bill, for that introduction and for the welcome on behalf of the Ironworkers Local 17 here in Cleveland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ironworkers were with me the first time I ran, as a 29-year-old kid, for the Senate.&nbsp; And you’re all crazy.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>I remember you got a guy named Tommy Schranck who was the president of a Local in Delaware.&nbsp; And he said, “Let’s go out and meet some of the guys and women.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>We went out to a buil- &#8212; a construction site.&nbsp; We went up a makeshift elevator.&nbsp; We went up 13 floors.&nbsp; They’re sitting on 18-inch beams, eating their lunch.&nbsp; I’m thinking to myself, “My God, these guys are supporting me.”&nbsp; But they’re the guys I grew up with.</p>



<p>You know, the people you heard speak earlier today &#8212; and I apologize, I’m going to repeat some of what they said.&nbsp; But, you know, we all come from the neighborhood.&nbsp; We all come from &#8212; no, I mean it.&nbsp; I &#8212; I was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which was a union town, mostly coalmine union town &#8212; a lot more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My great-grandfather was a &#8212; worked in the mines, was a mining engineer.&nbsp; And everybody &#8212; everybody there &#8212; there was only one word you heard most often in my family.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Most important word wasn’t “unions,” it was “dignity.”&nbsp; “Dignity.”&nbsp; Everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity.</p>



<p>My dad &#8212; (applause) &#8212; then we moved to a little town &#8212; when coal died, we moved to a town called Claymont, Delaware, just across the line in &#8212; from Pennsylvania, where the Delaware River bends.</p>



<p>And, you know, you used to have over 6,000 &#8212; 6,000 steelworkers &#8212; were steel.&nbsp; It’s all gone now.&nbsp; All of it, gone.&nbsp; Used to be a company town, literally.&nbsp; The hills were all company stores, company &#8212; company buildings.&nbsp; But it’s gone.&nbsp; And the union movement began to just crumble in Delaware and in Claymont.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And my dad never belonged to a union, but I say this at the front end: My dad was a salesperson.&nbsp; And he came down from Scranton when coal died.&nbsp; He wasn’t a coalminer, but he worked in sales up there.</p>



<p>And I’ll never forget: We lived in a &#8212; we lived in a three-bedroom, split-level home, like a lot of suburban areas developing in the early ‘50s and mid-‘50s.&nbsp; And there were, I think, 38, 40 homes.&nbsp; And they were &#8212; and we had four kids in the family and a grandpop living with us and mom and dad.</p>



<p>And the walls were thin.&nbsp; And my dad &#8212; one night, I could tell he was really restless.&nbsp; I could hear him and sort of a &#8212; not banging, but leaning up against the wall in the room &#8212; my room.</p>



<p>Next morning, I asked my &#8212; my dad had an expression.&nbsp; He said, “Joey, you never complain and never explain.&nbsp; Just get up.&nbsp; Just get up.”</p>



<p>And I was wondering what was wrong.&nbsp; And I asked my mom.&nbsp; She said, “The company says no pensions.&nbsp; No pensions.”</p>



<p>And so, you know, a lot of you come from families like mine &#8212; a lot of the people who stood behind me.&nbsp; Richie Neal from the state of Massachusetts &#8212; (applause) &#8212; he is, as my uncle would say &#8212; Richie is &#8212; he is union from belt buckle to shoe sole, man.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>And &#8212; but all the folks you heard speak today care about it, because we know what it’s like to be deprived of your dignity.&nbsp; We know what it’s like to have a father or a mother have to put their head down when they know they can’t afford a thing for their kid that they need, whether it’s a prescription or whether it’s just plain being able to go off to school.</p>



<p>And the point I want to make is this: We all understand this.&nbsp; And when I ran for office this time &#8212; and I’ve been a union supporter for my whole career.&nbsp; But I made a promise.&nbsp; I mean it sincerely, and Marty knows this.&nbsp; I guaranteed, when the &#8212; you know, when the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed and &#8212; back in the ‘30s &#8212; and Roosevelt came along, it didn’t say unions were okay.&nbsp; It says we should “encourage” unions.&nbsp; Encourage unions.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Because when unions do well, everybody does well.&nbsp; Everybody does well.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Not a joke.</p>



<p>So here’s the deal.&nbsp; The deal is quite simple.&nbsp; When I ran, I was criticized for the basis upon which I ran.&nbsp; I said I’m running for three reasons. One, to restore the soul of America &#8212; the decency and honor of this country.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And, two, to rebuild the backbone of the country.&nbsp; The backbone of the country are the working women and men, the middle class.&nbsp; And, you know, there’s a middle class for one reason: American unions.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; That&#8217;s the only reason there&#8217;s a middle class.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a fact.&nbsp; Not a joke.</p>



<p>And when the middle class does well, everybody does well &#8212; people have a way up, and the wealthy still do very well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, folks, the third reason I ran was to unify the country &#8212; to unify it.&nbsp; That&#8217;s been the harder part of it right now.&nbsp; No, I&#8217;m serious.&nbsp; Because we’ve become so divided &#8212; so divided in this.&nbsp; But one thing we were divided on when we ran &#8212; and, you know, I want to thank Mayor Bibb for the passport into the city.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>But we &#8212; we were divided on the question we&#8217;re celebrating today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, folks, how about actually having a union guy as Secretary of Labor?&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t that something?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you, Marty.</p>



<p>And I know we have a fantastic Secretary of Housing and Urban Development: Cleveland&#8217;s own Marcia Fudge.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; She&#8217;s &#8212; she wished she was going to be here.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m also honored to be here with Senator Sherrod Brown, a great champion of working folks.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; He really is.&nbsp; He really is.</p>



<p>And thank you also for the incredible Democratic members of Congress here.&nbsp; Marcy Kaptur &#8212; God love you, Marcy.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; You are the best.&nbsp; She does it all &#8212; unions and foreign policy.&nbsp; And for- &#8212; and you think I&#8217;m joking.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not joking.&nbsp; She really knows more about foreign policy.&nbsp; She&#8217;s forgotten more than most members of Congress know.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>And, Shontel Brown, just remember me when you&#8217;re president, okay?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; All right?&nbsp; Congratulations.</p>



<p>Look, and Richie Neal is not only a strong, strong union supporter and been a great supporter of this legislation, but he&#8217;s chairman of the most powerful committee in the United States Congress, the House Ways and Means Committee &#8212; the guys with the money.&nbsp; The guys with money.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s led on labored issue &#8212; labor issues for decades.</p>



<p>You know, while they couldn&#8217;t be here, I also want to thank Senator Tim Ryan &#8212; future Senator Tim Ryan &#8212; (applause) &#8212; and Senator Patty Murray of the state of Washington for their incredible work on this legislation.</p>



<p>With everyone&#8217;s leadership and with their votes and, most of all, with the unrelenting commitment of labor and all of you, this historic day is made possible.&nbsp; And it really is historic.</p>



<p>This was $90 billion, okay?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; But it&#8217;s small in comparison to the bailouts of businesses and major corporations and banks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, folks, I&#8217;m here today to talk about the issue that affects every single American and their retirement.&nbsp; People around the country wake up every day wondering whether they&#8217;ve saved enough to provide for themselves and their families before they stop working &#8212; work at a job that provides basic dignity, a good middle-class job you can raise a family on, a job that provides a dignified retirement and will give you peace of mind.</p>



<p>Think of all the people &#8212; and many of you went to bed at night putting your head on the pillow and saying, “Am I going to be all right?&nbsp; Is my family going to be all right?&nbsp; Is my wife or my husband or my child, are they going to be okay?”</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a dignified retirement with your spouse in the home in your community you worked and lived for your whole life.&nbsp; But the reality is for so many people: The goalposts keep moving.&nbsp; Unfor- &#8212; that’s probably Trump calling me.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I hear &#8212; I hear that sound there.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this happens to people who need it most: working people in this country.&nbsp; A lot of politicians like to talk about how they&#8217;re going to do something about it.&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m here today to say we&#8217;ve done something about it.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And I&#8217;ve kept their promise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I campaigned to restore the backbone of this country &#8212; the middle class and unions &#8212; because I know this: The middle class built American unions, built the middle class today.&nbsp; I&#8217;m keeping the promise &#8212; one of the most significant achievement union workers and retirees have received in over 50 years.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s not hyperbole.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>For years and years, union workers have been driving trucks from factories to stores, bagging your groceries, constructing the buildings, bridges, roads we need, and so much more.&nbsp; The ironworkers, bricklayers, carpenters, laborers, plumbers, truck drivers, musicians, I might add.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Food workers and so much more.</p>



<p>And with each paycheck you earn, their employers put money into their pension plans.&nbsp; These workers work hard today to secure a retirement tomorrow.&nbsp; That’s what it’s all about.</p>



<p>Now, a lot of businesses aren’t able or willing to run their own pension plans.&nbsp; And in some industries, workers are employed by several different employers over the course of a year or longer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, we see that in transportation, construction, and entertainment.&nbsp; So working with the union that represents their employees, businesses in the same industry often come together to form what’s called multi-employer union &#8212; and I know you know this, but people listening to this on television may not know this &#8212; pension plans that serve 11 million Americans across the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And to make sure these pensions are managed responsibly and to protect the participating workers and retirees, the federal government oversees and insures the plans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we’ve seen the risk of millions of workers face as they watch their hard-earned pensions turn into broken promises.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We saw it before the pandemic and the economic crisis that followed.&nbsp; Millions of retirees were at risk of losing their retirement security, through no fault of their own, based on conditions and unrelenting attacks on unions that were taking place.</p>



<p>Two hundred multiemployer pension plans for 2 to 3 million workers and retirees were going insolvent.&nbsp; What that means is to those 2 or 3 million workers &#8212; they faced painful cuts to the benefits they counted on and for the dignified security of retirement.</p>



<p>You just heard from Bill what it’s like to work 30, 40, 50 years &#8212; working hard every day, doing everything to provide for your family; track every dollar of that paycheck for groceries, the mortgage, and, hopefully, for a family vacation maybe one day; knowing when it’s time to retire, your pension you earned will be there; knowing that together with your Social Security benefits, that pension will continue a good middle-class life for you in retirement.&nbsp; For some, just &#8212; my dad used to say, “Just a little peace of mind.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But for folks at home, imagine losing 50 or 60 percent of that pension through absolutely no fault of your own.&nbsp; Imagine what it does financially and emotionally, what it does to your dignity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also here is Davey Grubbs, a retired Teamsters truck driver from North Carolina who faced nearly 70 percent cut in his pension.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And now also joining me today is Rita Lewis.&nbsp; Where are you, Rita?&nbsp; Rita is here somewhere, I&#8217;m told.&nbsp; She stepped out.&nbsp; I don’t blame her.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; You know, she&#8217;s Butch’s widow.&nbsp; And their anniversary is coming up in a couple of days.&nbsp; Childhood sweethearts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Butch was a ballplayer drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates out of high school, but he enlisted in the United States Army instead.&nbsp; Special Forces Army Ranger.&nbsp; Served in Vietnam.&nbsp; Earned, like my son, the Bronze Star.&nbsp; My son did not earn the Purple Heart, but &#8212; and the Purple Heart.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Came back home to Rita, settled in Cincinnati.&nbsp; Became a trucker represented by the Teamsters, and then president of his local.&nbsp; Known as an honorable, honest, and decent labor leader.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Butch faced severe cuts in his pension, and he became a fierce advocate for protecting the pensions of his fellow workers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Butch died more than 16 years &#8212; 6 years ago.&nbsp; And Rita has carried on his legacy ever since.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And with the &#8212; with &#8212; and with the Democrats in Congress, I might add, and Marty Walsh’s leadership, we brought the Butch &#8212; he &#8212; we fought for the Butch Lewis Act to protect pensions for millions of workers and retirees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a candidate for President, I argued for its passage and promised, when it passed, I would sign it.&nbsp; And that’s the promise I&#8217;ve kept when I &#8212; I included the Butch Lewis Act in the American Rescue Plan. (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, multi-employer plans will remain solvent for decades to come at least until &#8212; guaranteed until 2051.&nbsp; These retirees &#8212; those retirees who lost their benefits will have them restored retroactively.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We turned a promised broken into a promised kept.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It matters to workers.&nbsp; It matters to their families.&nbsp; It matters to the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You all remember what the economy was like when I was elected: a country in a pandemic with no real plans how to get out of it &#8212; millions of people out of their jobs, families in cars &#8212; remember? &#8212; backed up for literally miles, waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk.&nbsp; Just a &#8212; a box of food to be put in their trunk because they didn’t have enough to eat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The previous administration lost more jobs on its watch than any administration since Herbert Hoover<a></a> &#8212; that’s a fact &#8212; all based on failed trickle-down economics that benefitted the wealthiest Americans and hit the middle class and working people the hardest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we came in with a fundamentally different economic vision: an economy that grows from the bottom up and the middle out.&nbsp; It’s good for everyone, because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>And that’s why we designed the American Rescue Plan based on &#8212; based on the belief that a recovery should help all Americans prosper, a belief that working &#8212; building power and unions are good for workers and for the economy, a plan that led to the most jobs created in the first period of a presidency than any time in over &#8212; in all American history.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And we’ve seen in the past how economic crisis can leave so many Americans in tough straits for years, sometimes for the rest of their lives.&nbsp; Economists call it the “scarring effect” &#8212; the lasting bad effects of economic hardship, including folks unemployed for a long time.</p>



<p>Remember, when we started this, a lot of people were equally as qualified, but they’d been unemployed for 8, 10, 12 months; they wouldn’t even be considered.&nbsp; Two people put in an application &#8212; the person may be more qualified but unemployed &#8212; out of &#8212; out of work for longer.&nbsp; It’s called the “scarring effect” &#8212; people not able to get back to work.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; But we changed that.&nbsp; And young people who faced a weak labor market &#8212; they’re back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Losing a big part of your income late in life, that’s a scar, though, that doesn’t heal.&nbsp; Well, not this time.&nbsp; Long-term unemployment and youth unemployment dropped at a record pace.&nbsp; With today’s actions, millions of workers will have the dignified retirement they earned and they deserve.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And, folks, let’s be honest: I’d love to tell you, everyone, that &#8212; here that this policy that honors hard work and ensures dignified retirement was universally supported, regardless of political party.&nbsp; But this is an important point and this really matters: Unfortunately, that’s not the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not one single Republican &#8212; not &#8212; no, this is &#8212; I mean, this is what I’m talking about.  Not one single solitary Republican voted for the Butch Lewis Act or this legislation.<br><br>AUDIENCE:  Booo &#8212;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  And, folks &#8212; and, folks, I can tell you, those of us in the &#8212; were &#8212; I was in the Congress a long time, and the people are still in the Congress &#8212; there’s ones who wanted to, but they’re afraid to &#8212; afraid to &#8212; because the Trumpers would literally take them out.  Not a joke.  That’s how bad it’s gotten.  We’ve got to change it.  We’ve got to change it.<br><br>In fact, when this bill was moving through Congress, Republicans called it &#8212; called these pensions, quote, “rat holes.”  That was their &#8212; no, that was their phrase on the floor &#8212; “rat holes.”</p>



<p>Who do they think they are?  Who do they think you are, for God’s sake?  And my predecessor had the chance to act, but he didn’t have the commitment to you or the courage to stand up to his own party to get things done, dismissing and ignoring the forgotten people he promised to help.  Remember how he was going to help working-class folks? </p>



<p>But tax cut for the wealthiest Americans &#8212; he had no trouble passing that.&nbsp; They passed a $2 trillion tax cut, not a penny of which was paid for.&nbsp; Increased the debt by $2 trillion.&nbsp; The vast majority of people making the top 1 percent of income, the biggest corporations and their &#8212; their biggest cheerleaders of that two thou- &#8212; $2 trillion tax cut.&nbsp; Again, disproportionately benefitted the wealthiest &#8212; the wealthiest Americans.<br><br>Protecting a system in which, for example, the 55 of the largest Fortune 500 companies in America paid zero in taxes.&nbsp; Zero.</p>



<p><br>They made &#8212; they made $40 billion.&nbsp; Didn’t pay a single penny.<br><br>The party that choose to make life more comfortable for the already comfortable disparage and oppose retirement security for working people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And now, when Republicans actually do offer a plan &#8212; and they finally &#8212; we &#8212; you know, I’m not joking.&nbsp; Ask yourself this question: What is the Republican platform going into this campaign?<br><br>AUDIENCE:&nbsp; (Inaudible.)<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; I’m not &#8212; I’m being deadly earnest.&nbsp; I’m not trying to be poli- &#8212; just &#8212; just a fact.<br><br>Well, they have a guy who is the &#8212; Rick Scott from Florida, who heads up the Republican Campaign Committee.&nbsp; He put out the plan.&nbsp; What does that plan do?&nbsp; It makes the tax system less fair by giving &#8212; wanting to tax everybody making under $100,000 significantly more, on average &#8212; a lot more money.&nbsp; It actually raises taxes on those working families because he thinks you don’t pay enough in taxes already.<br><br>No, no.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; I can &#8212; I should have brought along the actual copy of the plan, but go online and get &#8212; no, for real.&nbsp; It’s been published.&nbsp; They published it.&nbsp; They think we’re freeloaders.<br><br>But he’s not &#8212; but he’s got a problem with a tax code that allows billionaires &#8212; none at all, no problem &#8212; trillion and billionaires in America &#8212; there’s 789 or thereabouts.&nbsp; You know what their average federal income tax they pay?&nbsp; Eight percent.<br><br>Every one of you have a job pays more than 8 percent &#8212; every single one of you.&nbsp; If you’re a cop, a teacher, a firefighter, union worker, you probably pay two to three times that.&nbsp; Now, after refusing to protect your pension, they’re going after your Social Security.<br><br>Look, I would have thought, had I not seen it on paper and heard them talk about it, that I was making this up.&nbsp; Not a joke.<br><br><br></p>



<p>His big idea is put Social Security on the chopping block every five years.&nbsp; That is: Every five years, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid have to be reauthorized or they go out of existence.</p>



<p>Social Security you paid in from the day you started working.&nbsp; It’s your other pension.&nbsp; You paid into it every single paycheck.&nbsp; You earned it.&nbsp; It’s your money, just like your pension.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And he adds in Medicare and Medicaid for the chopping block every five years.&nbsp; Unless Congress explicitly votes to extend those programs, they go away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know how they work the rules in the Senate.&nbsp; The ability to slow this up and keep that from happening is real.</p>



<p>You know how hard it is to get anything done in Congress.&nbsp; Imagine what it would mean if Republicans had their way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, the ultra-MAGA Republicans &#8212; Congress is deciding every five years whether the &#8212; your promise of your hard-earned Medicare and Social Security would be continued or discontinued or slashed.&nbsp; It’s shameful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Rick Scott is not alone.&nbsp; Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is talking &#8212;</p>



<p>AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Booo &#8212;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; No, he has a proposal to cut Social Security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And by the way, I might note, parenthetically: As President &#8212; the first year I was President, I cut the federal deficit by $350 billion.&nbsp; And do you know how much I cut it this year?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Cut &#8212; cut this year &#8212; by the end of September, I will have cut the federal budget by $1 trillion 400 billion &#8212; cut the deficit.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, when they start talking about you being big spenders, just point them to that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But here’s the point: Republicans are talking about privatizing social security &#8212; privatizing social sec- &#8212;</p>



<p>AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Booo &#8212;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; No, I &#8212; this is not a jo- &#8212; I mean, you know, we used to hear this stuff and think they didn’t mean it, but they’ve written it down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The senator from Wisconsin, Ron Johnson, promised again that if they regain power, they’re going to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What does that mean?&nbsp; It means that if any of you who have a preexisting condition will automatically lose insurance.&nbsp; Because the insurance companies are able to &#8212; right now, because of the Affordable Care Act, no one can be denied insurance because they have a preexisting condition.&nbsp; It’s the only thing that &#8212;</p>



<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; (Inaudible.)</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; &#8212; no.&nbsp; And by the &#8212; we’re talking 90 million people with preexisting conditions gone.&nbsp; Gone.</p>



<p>They tried to do it about 17 times last &#8212; under Trump.&nbsp; We were able to stop them.</p>



<p>But, folks, this is a different world.&nbsp; I don’t know where they live.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, I’m not joking.&nbsp; That’s why elections have consequences, and that’s why they matter, and that’s why what we’re doing here is so important.</p>



<p>Let me close with this: We’ve made incredible cogress [sic] on the &#8212; progress on the economy from where we were a year and half ago.&nbsp; We got a long way to go because of inflation and because of the &#8212; I call it “the Putin tax increase” &#8212; “Putin” because of gasoline and all that grain he’s keeping from being able to get to the market.</p>



<p>Now I’m fighting like hell to lower costs on the things that you talk about around your kitchen table.&nbsp; My dad used to say, “At the end of the day, it’s just, when you sit at that table, do you have enough money to pay for everything you need?”&nbsp; Not a lot over.&nbsp; Do you have enough money to pay for everything you need?</p>



<p><a>While Republicans do nothing <s>to</s> [but] obstruct our efforts to lower your gas taxes </a>&#8212; I’ve proposed that and I’ve asked the Congress to eliminate the federal gas tax for the next &#8212; as long as this crisis goes on; to lower food prices, lower healthcare costs; hopefully soon, lower your prescription drug costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the way, you’ve got a &#8212; you got a Republican leader in the United States Senate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was able to work out something with Intel.&nbsp; They’re going to provide for over 7,000 jobs in this state, out of Columbus &#8212; (applause) &#8212; making computer chips.</p>



<p><a>Well, there’s another bill that, if we get it passed &#8212; and my guys are working like hell to pass it &#8212; it’ll create another $100 <s>million</s> [billion] in investments in Ohio, creating more jobs.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>But do you know what?&nbsp; You know what the Republican leader is saying?&nbsp; If, in fact, we pass the law that says Medicare can negotiate drug prices like they can for the military; if, in fact, we pass the plan that says we’re going to raise taxes on multi-millionaires so they start paying their fair share, then he’s going to block the passage of the legislation that will provide for another $100 billion invested in this state.</p>



<p>Folks, this is not right.&nbsp; This is not right.&nbsp; And that’s why this election is going to be so darn important.&nbsp; The key is that we just have to remember who built this country.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I know I remember.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Tomorrow, I’ll be awarding the highest honor that can be given to a civilian, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to our dear friend the late Rich Trumka, who fought so damn hard to protect &#8212; (applause) &#8212; for the protection of these pensions.&nbsp; He once said unions &#8212; quote, “We do America’s work.”&nbsp; Unions do America’s work.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This Fourth of July, let’s remember who &#8212; who is the backbone of this country.&nbsp; It’s you, the American worker.&nbsp; I promised you I would be the most pro-labor, pro-union, pro-worker&nbsp;President in our history.&nbsp; And there’s another promise I am going to be keeping as well.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; So, let me tell you something: There’s no other place I want to be than right here with the workers in this room and the workers that built America.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>I see you, I hear you, and I’ll always have your back.&nbsp; I promise.&nbsp; God bless you.&nbsp; And may God protect our troops.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Biden Administration will facilitate air shipment of over 3.1 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Kendamil infant formula on July 17 and 22</em></p>



<p><br>Today, President Biden is announcing that his Administration is sourcing a flight, facilitated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), for Operation Fly Formula to transport Kendamil baby formula from England to New York, NY via flights on July 17 and 22 respectively. These two deliveries will include in total approximately 200,000 pounds of Kendamil EU Classic First Infant Milk Stage 1 and Kendamil EU Organic First Infant Milk Stage 1, the equivalent of approximately 3.1 million 8-ounce bottles. The product will be available at Target stores. Parents and Pediatricians can learn more about Kendamil infant formula at <a href="https://us.kendamil.com">https://us.kendamil.com</a>  and compare its nutritional content per 100kcal with other leading formula brands at <a href="https://us.kendamil.com/pages/compare-kendamil">https://us.kendamil.com/pages/compare-kendamil</a>.</p>



<p>In May, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the agency is exercising enforcement discretion so that Kendamil can export additional infant formula into the U.S., including&nbsp;Kendamil EU Classic First Infant Milk Stage 1 and Kendamil EU Organic First Infant Milk Stage 1. Kendamil plans to export approximately 58 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents into the U.S. market over the next 6 months.</p>



<p>President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the import of infant formula and start getting more formula to stores as soon as possible. Under Operation Fly Formula, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense (DOD) are partnering to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S. health and safety standards, so it can get to store shelves faster. By July 10, Operation Fly Formula will have transported more than 43 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents to the U.S.</p>



<p>In addition, the Biden Administration has taken a number of other important actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula for families, including invoking the Defense Production Act, entering into a consent agreement between the FDA and Abbott Nutrition to reopen the company’s Sturgis facility, and issuing FDA guidance so that major formula manufacturers can safely import formula that is not currently being produced for the U.S. market. Details of our actions can be found at whitehouse.gov/formula.</p>

<p>Kate Bedingfield, a longtime trusted aide to President Biden and a senior strategist both in the administration and on his winning campaign, will leave the White House in late July to spend more time with her husband and young children after more than 3 straight years of leading his communications team. She first worked for the President as his communications director during his time as Vice President.<br><br>Bedingfield previously served as the Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director on the President’s 2020 presidential campaign, playing a leading role advising him on messaging, building his communications and press operations, preparing him for debates and interviews, and devising and executing on strategy as he secured the Democratic nomination faster than any candidate since 2004 and became the first nominee to defeat an incumbent president in almost 30 years. She also represented the campaign on television at key moments, including before and after debates.<br><br>In the White House, Bedingfield continued as the President’s top communications aide and was similarly integral to every major public relations effort while leading the White House Communications Department, ensuring that each part of the team was working to deliver the President’s message and advocate for his agenda.<br><br>“Without Kate Bedingfield’s talent and tenacity, Donald Trump might still be in the White House, the Rescue Plan and the Infrastructure Law might still be unrealized goals, and Ketanji Brown Jackson might not be sitting on the Supreme Court,” <strong>said White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain.</strong> “She has played a huge role in everything the President has achieved – from his second term as Vice President, through the campaign, and since coming to the White House.  Her strategic acumen, intense devotion to the President’s agenda, and fierce work on his behalf are unmatched.  She will continue to remain a critical player in moving the Biden agenda forward from the outside.”<br><br>“From long before we launched the campaign, Kate Bedingfield was a fierce defender of the President and ensured that our message in 2020 and in the White House was consistent with his voice and principles,” <strong>said White House Senior Adviser Anita Dunn.</strong> “Her leadership helped us tell the story about the fight Joe Biden is making for the working families of America.  She’ll always be a core member of this family, even as she takes a little time to put her own family first.  We will miss her intelligence, her talent, her sense of humor, and her commitment to the values President Biden fought for as a candidate and fights for every day as president.”</p>
