										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>In 1919, Army Lieutenant Colonel Dwight D. Eisenhower joined a cross-country convoy of trucks and tanks to determine if our Nation had the capacity to transport military assets.&nbsp; He&nbsp;discovered a poorly connected patchwork of roads that were unsafe for civilians and unsuitable for our military needs.&nbsp; When he became the President 34 years later, Dwight Eisenhower made connecting the Nation a top priority by creating the unprecedented Interstate Highway System that linked the country to coast-to-coast travel and commerce, revolutionized public safety, and unleashed America&#8217;s unrivaled sense of discovery and exploration.</p>



<p>Today, America&#8217;s transportation system weaves together distant communities into one Nation, making our economy more competitive in the global market and enabling our American way of life. &nbsp;On National Defense Transportation Day and during National Transportation Week, we recognize the importance of our Nation&#8217;s infrastructure to our national and economic security.</p>



<p>We also recognize that our transportation systems are not equally accessible to all groups. &nbsp;They link some neighborhoods while undermining, dividing, and leaving others behind.&nbsp; They create pollution and contribute to climate change.&nbsp; In addition, many of our roads, bridges, waterways, and airports that were once ranked among the best in the world have fallen into disrepair due to neglect and lack of investment.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why last year I signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law &#8212; the largest investment in America&#8217;s infrastructure since President Dwight Eisenhower and the largest single investment ever in our roads, bridges, passenger rail, and public transit. &nbsp;These historic investments are funding crucial repairs to the infrastructure that our Nation relies on&nbsp;so heavily for interstate commerce and national security.&nbsp; The&nbsp;law also modernizes our Nation&#8217;s ports and waterways, strengthening our supply chains, our economic growth, and our global competitiveness while protecting communities from the accelerating impact of climate change.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Working together, governments at every level will be positioned to deliver tangible results for the American people ‑- safer roads, better public transit options, and a national network of electric vehicle charging infrastructure. &nbsp;We will reconnect communities and create good-paying jobs, building and maintaining infrastructure projects that are funded by this landmark legislation.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During National Transportation Week, we acknowledge the importance of our transportation infrastructure and honor the men and women who design, build, operate, and maintain it. &nbsp;We&nbsp;also recognize transportation workers who serve traveling Americans every day. &nbsp;As we enter a new era in transportation infrastructure, my Administration will continue to support our Nation&#8217;s evolving transportation needs to fuel long-term economic growth and improve the quality of life for all Americans.</p>



<p>In recognition of the ongoing contributions of our Nation&#8217;s transportation system and in honor of the devoted professionals who work to sustain its tradition of excellence, the United States Congress has requested, by joint resolution approved May&nbsp;16, 1957, as amended (36 U.S.C. 120), that the President designate the third Friday in May of each year as &#8220;National Defense Transportation Day&#8221; and, by joint resolution approved May 14, 1962 (36 U.S.C. 133), that the week in which that Friday falls be designated as &#8220;National Transportation Week.&#8221;</p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Friday, May 20, 2022, as National Defense Transportation Day and May 15 through May 21, 2022, as National Transportation Week.&nbsp; I&nbsp;urge&nbsp;all Americans to observe these occasions with appropriate ceremonies, programs, and activities as we show our appreciation to those who build and operate our Nation&#8217;s transportation systems.</p>



<p>&nbsp;IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United&nbsp;States of&nbsp;America the two&nbsp;hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>    American workers are the finest in the world, and my Administration remains steadfast in our commitment to building a better America by pursuing a trade agenda that puts workers first and helps foster a fairer, more inclusive, more prosperous, and more resilient Nation.  During World Trade Week, we highlight the importance of global trade and the role it plays in raising the quality of life of American families while strengthening our economy and our workforce.  </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no limit to what our Nation can achieve when we work together, and I know that we can out-compete any country in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;Winning the competition for the 21st century requires investing in our country and our people here at home, and that is exactly what my Administration is doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we saw an unprecedented revival of American manufacturing and the pride that comes with stamping products &#8220;Made in America.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;From automobiles and semiconductors to clean energy technologies, companies are building here in America again; we added over 350,000 manufacturing jobs to the economy in 2021 &#8212; the best year for manufacturing jobs in nearly three decades.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are making crucial investments in our Nation&#8217;s infrastructure, including in our ports, highways, roads, airports, and bridges, which American companies rely on to export goods.&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies have announced billions of dollars in new investments to produce and manufacture more goods right here on American soil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only are we building American products and services here at home &#8212; we are selling them around the globe.&nbsp;&nbsp;My&nbsp;Administration has developed a comprehensive trade policy that increases and diversifies the pool of American businesses engaging in international trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have set a bold goal to double the number of businesses receiving export assistance from the Department of Commerce, with particular emphasis on engaging with businesses in historically underserved communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;We&nbsp;have made it possible for small and medium enterprises engaged in export-oriented manufacturing projects to benefit from medium- and long-term loans and loan guarantees offered by the Export-Import Bank of the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Administration continues to marshal a whole-of-government approach to address issues that threaten our economic security and prosperity &#8212; from an unprecedented pandemic and the climate crisis to global conflict and geopolitical instability.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are making investments to strengthen our global supply chains even as we strengthen our domestic supply chains in critical industries, and we are standing up to bring an end to unfair foreign trade practices that harm American workers, producers, and businesses.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also deepening our crucial bilateral and multilateral economic relationships with partners and allies to ensure a level playing field for United States businesses and workers and build a more stable, fair, and dependable international economic arena.&nbsp;&nbsp;This entails working together to enforce existing trade agreements while establishing new and improved trade frameworks.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also recommitting the United&nbsp;States to global multilateral institutions, including the World Trade Organization, in pursuit of more durable, resilient, and sustainable trade policies that deliver better results for American workers and families.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we are resolving ongoing issues with our trading partners and using trade as a tool to help address our common challenges, including climate change and the threat of unfair competition from non-market and authoritarian regimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;We reached a groundbreaking deal with the European Union that included a commitment to negotiate the world&#8217;s first emission-based trade arrangement on steel and aluminum trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;We&nbsp;concluded a 17-year international commercial aviation dispute that will support good-paying jobs here at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;We reached deals with the United Kingdom and Japan on steel and aluminum.&nbsp;&nbsp;We addressed environmental protections through the United&nbsp;States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also using trade to rebuild our alliances and meet shared security challenges, which threaten our networks, our quality of life, and the strength of our democracies.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are ushering in a new era of transatlantic cooperation between the United States and the European Union &#8212; including the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council and Transatlantic Data Privacy Framework &#8212; and developing an Indo-Pacific Economic Framework to strengthen our economic and trade relationships with partners in the region.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now more than ever, we need our trade policies to deliver for American workers and families.&nbsp;&nbsp;With strong investments and resources &#8212; and a bold strategy for inclusive and long-lasting economic prosperity &#8212; American businesses and workers will continue to meet every challenge and win the competition for the 21st century.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 15 through May 21, 2022, as World Trade Week.&nbsp;&nbsp;I call upon all Americans to observe this week and to celebrate with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.</p>



<p>     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>    Every day, emergency medical service (EMS) providers put the needs of their communities above their own as they respond to crises, treat injuries, and save lives.  Their heroism has been on full display throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, as resilient EMS workers across the country have provided essential care to Americans.  This year&#8217;s Emergency Medical Services Week theme, &#8220;Rising to the Challenge,&#8221; pays tribute to the brave frontline professionals who work tirelessly to help their fellow Americans get immediate medical attention in their hours of greatest need.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With compassion, determination, and skill, EMS providers embody the best of our Nation &#8212; from paramedics, 911 dispatchers, and emergency medical technicians to nurses, law enforcement officers, and firefighters.&nbsp;&nbsp;Collectively, they distributed COVID-19 vaccinations, provided aid after medical emergencies and disasters, and eased our suffering in countless ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;The unwavering commitment of EMS providers to public service often comes at the cost of their own physical well-being, mental health, and precious time with loved ones.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why my American Rescue Plan included billions of dollars to support women and men who serve in EMS roles.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also made it a priority to ensure that our State, local, Tribal, and territorial partners have the resources they need to&nbsp;train and equip EMS providers so they can respond to public health emergencies safely and effectively.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During Emergency Medical Services Week, we share our appreciation for the selfless EMS professionals who provide lifesaving services every day&nbsp;and risk their lives each time they answer the call of service.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also honor the EMS providers who have made the ultimate sacrifice&nbsp;in the line of duty to protect their fellow Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Nation owes a tremendous debt of gratitude to these heroes and their loved ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;May God bless our Nation&#8217;s EMS workers and their families.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 15 through May 21, 2022, as National Emergency Medical Services Week.&nbsp;&nbsp;I call upon public officials, doctors, nurses, paramedics, EMS providers, and all the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities to honor our brave EMS workers and to pay tribute to the EMS providers who lost their lives in the line of duty.</p>



<p>     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;For generations, courageous men and women of our Nation&#8217;s law enforcement community have dedicated their lives to protecting us in big cities, small towns, and suburban neighborhoods across America.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each morning, police officers pin&nbsp;on their shield and walk out the door to go to work, hoping they will come home safely.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, a record number of law enforcement officers died in the line of duty.&nbsp;&nbsp;On Peace Officers Memorial Day and during Police Week, we express our gratitude for these selfless public servants who put themselves in harm&#8217;s way to keep us safe and honor those who lost their lives in the line of duty.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we see a rise in gun violence and other violent crimes, it is critical that we fund law enforcement with the resources and training they need to do their jobs safely and effectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 billion that cities, States, counties, and tribes can use to hire more police officers and invest in proven strategies like community violence intervention, youth programming, and other supportive services.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also why my proposed 2023 budget more than doubles funding for effective community policing through the Community Oriented Policing Services Hiring Program.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, my budget increases support for the United States Marshals and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, so they can apprehend fugitives and fight illegal gun trafficking.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gun violence not only affects community members, it also targets law enforcement officers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month at the White&nbsp;House,&nbsp;surrounded by law enforcment, community leaders, and families who have lost loved ones to gun violence, we announced that&nbsp;the Department of Justice is reining in the proliferation of &#8220;ghost guns&#8221; &#8212; privately-made firearms without serial numbers that are increasingly showing up on our streets and being used to attack law enforcement officers and members of the public.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Administration is also committed to supporting programs that protect the physical safety of our law enforcement &#8212; more bulletproof vests, active shooter trainings, and early warnings of threats targeting officers.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also do more to protect our officers&#8217; mental health and emotional well-being.&nbsp;&nbsp;Suicide and COVID-19 were among the leading causes of death for law enforcement officers in 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last November, I was proud to sign into law three bills that extend critical peer counseling and mental health resources for officers, expand eligibility and benefits for first responders disabled in the line of duty, and protect Federal law enforcement serving abroad.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our officers swear an oath to protect us, and we owe them the same pledge.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not abandon our streets or accept the false choice between public safety and equal justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution is not to defund our police.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to make our streets more secure through policing that treats everyone with dignity and respect.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to provide officers with the resources, tools, and training they need to keep our neighborhoods safe.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During Police Week, let us demonstrate our appreciation for the unsung heroes who nobly wear the badge and put their lives at risk to protect people each and every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us honor the brave officers whose bright futures were cut short in the line of duty.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us come together to help police be the partners and protectors our communities and our Nation need for a safer, more just America.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended (76 Stat. 676), and by Public Law 103-322, as amended (36 U.S.C. 136-137), the President has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 of each year as &#8220;Peace Officers Memorial Day&#8221; and the week in which it falls as &#8220;Police Week.&#8221;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2022, as Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 15 through May 21, 2022, as Police Week.&nbsp;&nbsp;I call upon all Americans to observe these events with appropriate ceremonies and activities and salute our Nation&#8217;s brave law enforcement officers and remember their peace officer brothers and sisters who have given their last full measure of devotion in the line of duty.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also call on the Governors of the United States and its Territories, and appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;I further encourage all Americans to display the flag at half-staff from their homes and businesses on that day.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this<br>thirteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United&nbsp;States of&nbsp;America the two&nbsp;hundred and forty-sixth.<br>&nbsp;</p>

The public filing system serves to prevent financial conflicts of interest by providing for a systematic review of the finances of government officials. Those finances are set forth in annual disclosures, which are reviewed and certified by the independent Office of Government Ethics. Neither the President nor the Vice President have any conflicts of interest.</p>
