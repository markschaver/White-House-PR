<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>12:52 P.M. EST</p>



<p>MODERATOR: &nbsp;So thanks, everyone, for joining on short notice.&nbsp; So this is a background press call on the President’s announcement earlier today on the steps we’re taking to hold Russia accountable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This call is on background, attributable to a “senior administration official,” and embargoed until the call concludes.&nbsp; For your awareness and not for reporting, the speaker on this call is [senior administration official].&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, with that, I&#8217;m going to turn it over to [senior administration official] for some quick remarks, and then we can take some questions.</p>



<p>[Senior administration official], over to you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Okay, thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Hi, everybody.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll make a few comments and happy to take your questions afterwards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>America is united in its resolve to stand up to Putin.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s broad support across the country for degrading the strength of Putin’s economy and war machine through energy exports.</p>



<p>Today, President Biden signed an executive order to ban the import of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas, and coal to the United States.&nbsp; This is a significant action with widespread bipartisan support that will further deprive President Putin of the economic resources he uses to fund his needless war of choice.</p>



<p>Let me give you some details on the mechanics, our consultation with allies, and also the domestic implications.</p>



<p>First, in terms of mechanics: Our ban blocks any new purchases of Russian crude oil and certain petroleum products, liquefied natural gas, and coal, and winds downs the deliveries of existing purchases that have already been contracted for.&nbsp; It also bans new U.S. investment in Russia&#8217;s energy sector, which will ensure that American companies and American investors are not underwriting Putin&#8217;s efforts to expand energy production inside of Russia.</p>



<p>And finally, Americans will be prohibited from participating in foreign investments that flow into Russia&#8217;s energy sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, in taking this action, we consulted with European allies closely, but we do not expect them and did not ask them to join us.&nbsp; The United States is able to take this step because of our strong domestic energy production and infrastructure.&nbsp; And we recognize that not all of our Allies and partners are currently in a position to join us.</p>



<p>And specifically, let me maybe add two points of detail on this point.&nbsp; First in 2021, Russian oil was just under 10 percent of our overall imports of oil but a third of Europe&#8217;s imports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of last year, Europe imports more than six times more oil from Russia than we do &#8212; about four and a half million barrels for Europe versus seven hundred thousand barrels of oil for the U.S. per day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, the U.S. produces far more oil domestically than any of our allies.&nbsp; In fact, we&#8217;re a net exporter, the leading oil and gas producer in the world.&nbsp; And we produced more oil and gas in the first year of President Biden&#8217;s term than in his predecessor’s first year.</p>



<p>Third, in terms of domestic impact, the reality is Putin&#8217;s unprovoked and brutal war has led to higher energy prices and raised costs for Americans at home &#8212; about 75 cents at the gas pump &#8212; since Putin began to amass troops at the Ukrainian border in early November.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under President Biden&#8217;s leadership, the U.S. will continue to mitigate the pain American families feel at the pump and reduce our dependence on foreign oil and fossil fuels.&nbsp; And let me make three points in this regard.</p>



<p>First, the administration has already committed to releasing more than 90 million barrels from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve this fiscal year.&nbsp; This is the result of intensive, around-the-clock coordination and consultation by President Biden.&nbsp; And it led to IEA member countries agreeing to a collective release of an initial 60 million barrels of crude oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserves, with the U.S. committing about half of that emergency sale.</p>



<p>We also remain in active conversations with a range of energy producers and energy consumers on further steps we can take to ensure a global supply &#8212; a stable global supply of energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, U.S. oil and gas production is approaching record highs while thousands of drilling permits on federal lands go unused.&nbsp; So federal policies are not limiting the production of oil and gas.&nbsp; To the contrary, the Biden administration has been clear that in the short term, supply must keep up with demand at home and around the world while we make the shift to a secure clean energy future.</p>



<p>We are one of the world&#8217;s largest producers with a strong domestic oil and gas industry.&nbsp; Natural gas production in the U.S. has never been higher, and crude oil production is expected to hit a new record high next year.</p>



<p>As major energy company leaders have themselves said, they have the resources and the incentives they need to further increase production in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Third, in the long run, the way to avoid high gas prices is to speed up, not slow down, our transition to a clean energy future.&nbsp; The reality is we can&#8217;t drill our way out of dependence on a global commodity that&#8217;s controlled, in part, by foreign nations and their leaders, including Putin.&nbsp; The only way to eliminate Putin’s and every other producing country&#8217;s ability to use oil as an economic weapon is to reduce our dependency on oil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So even as President Biden does everything in his power in the short term to make sure we can readily access the oil &#8212; readily access oil and gas, we need to protect American consumers and allied countries, including through greater U.S. domestic production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This crisis reinforces our resolve to make America truly energy independent, which means reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last point I&#8217;ll make: You know, this announcement builds on unprecedented economic costs the U.S. and our allies and partners have imposed on Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just to remind everyone: As a result of our historic coordination, Russia has become a global economic and financial pariah.&nbsp; Over 30 counties, representing well over half the world&#8217;s economy have announced sanctions that impose immediate and debilitating economic costs on Russia, cut off its access to high tech, and sap its growth &#8212; growth potential and weaken its military for years to come.</p>



<p>You all have seen the Russian ruble is now worth much less than a penny; it&#8217;s hit an all-time low after losing well over half its value since Putin announced his further invasion of Ukraine.</p>



<p>By isolating Russia&#8217;s Central Bank from the global financial system, we&#8217;ve disarmed his war chest of foreign reserves and he can do very little to slow the freefall of his currency.</p>



<p>By blocking transactions with and freezing the assets of his largest banks, we&#8217;ve shut down Putin&#8217;s ability to do business with the world.</p>



<p>And the U.S. and governments all over the world are going after Putin&#8217;s assets and those of his cronies and their families by identifying where they are and freezing them in our respective jurisdictions.&nbsp; And that includes their yachts and luxury apartments and money and other ill-gotten gains.</p>



<p>Let me stop there.&nbsp; And I&#8217;d be happy to take your questions.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great. &nbsp;Thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; So, if you have a question, please raise your hand, and then I will just call on folks that way.</p>



<p>So I think let&#8217;s just go ahead and start with Andrea Shalal from Reuters, please.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so much, [senior administration official], for doing this.&nbsp; U.S. &#8212; does this affect &#8212; take effect immediately?&nbsp; And you &#8212; you mentioned about, you know, the sort of blocking new purchases, but winding down deliveries that are already contracted.&nbsp; When &#8212; you know, how much</p>



<p>volume is there in terms of what&#8217;s are already contracted?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Hi, Andrea.&nbsp; So, the ban is immediate.&nbsp; We block any new purchases of Russian energy.&nbsp; And we do allow, though, for wind downs of deliveries for existing purchases that were already contracted for.&nbsp; So that means, just to be clear with you, there are no new contracts that will be allowed.&nbsp; And for existing contracts, we are allowing a 45-day wind-down period.&nbsp; And I would refer you to the &#8212; to the Treasury Department for exactly how that will get executed.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Jennifer Jacobs from Bloomberg, please.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; On Venezuela, do the plans to license imports to Venezuelan oil, does that replace &#8212; could that replace the lost Russian barrels?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, so I don&#8217;t have &#8212; I don&#8217;t have anything to say with you about Venezuela.&nbsp; Sorry, can you can you hear me?&nbsp; Hello?</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Yeah, we can hear you, [senior administration official].</p>



<p>(The call experiences technical difficulties.)</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I can hear you.&nbsp; Yeah, sorry.&nbsp; I don’t know &#8212; I think I might have gotten cut off.</p>



<p>Jennifer, the question was on Venezuela, right?&nbsp; I think it was on Venezuela.</p>



<p>So, let me just say on that &#8212; on that trip that you&#8217;re referring to that was intended to discuss a range of issues, including the health and the welfare of detained U.S. citizens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And those meetings are ongoing, so I&#8217;m not going to &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to share any more detail at this point.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s do Tom Franck from CNBC, please.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, [senior administration official].&nbsp; I wanted to ask: CEA Chair Cecilia Rouse talked about this earlier in the week that any U.S. ban would be introduced in a way that would minimize disruption to global markets and minimize upward pressure on inflation.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just wondering if the White House has any estimates on how this ban could impact headline CPI, you know, over the next year or so.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, I&#8217;ll step back on this one and just say, you know, the President, he has said many times now that dictators need to pay a price for their aggression or they&#8217;ll just cause more chaos and increase costs and threats for America and people all over the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So that&#8217;s &#8212; that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s decided to stand up to Putin&#8217;s aggression.&nbsp; And he has told the truth that this is not going to be painless for Americans.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not going to give you a specific estimate on what will happen to gas prices.&nbsp; But let me &#8212; let me say the reason energy prices are rising right now is because of Putin&#8217;s choices and this needless war, and the risk that he could escalate further.</p>



<p>Of course, in addition to our resolve to hold him accountable, prices at the pump &#8212; at the gas pump are now up about 75 cents since Putin started to amass troops at Ukraine&#8217;s border.&nbsp; The price of Brent crude oil is up about $50 a barrel as well since that time.</p>



<p>So what we&#8217;re seeing now is a result of fears of Putin&#8217;s ongoing aggression escalating and the consequences of his actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we think this is a time for American resolve.&nbsp; There will be costs for standing up to Putin, but we&#8217;re doing all we can to mitigate those costs.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s do Sean Sullivan from the Washington Post, please.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks very much.&nbsp; Just to follow up on that, I know you said you didn&#8217;t want to go into what specific projections might be for where gas prices might be.&nbsp; But is that because the White House does not know or has not projected what this could mean for gas prices in the coming months, or that you just don&#8217;t want to share that?</p>



<p>And as a related question, how confident is the White House at this point that Americans will be willing over time to accept whatever increases result in gas prices at the pump as a result of this decision?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, I can share &#8212; you know, I&#8217;ll share some of the thinking.&nbsp; So, first thing to point out is that we&#8217;re not a major importer of Russian oil; it&#8217;s about 700,000 barrels a day.&nbsp; And remember that we&#8217;re a major producer of crude oil, usually &#8212; usually occupying the top spot.&nbsp; There are certain months where we’re number two, but we are a leading producer of crude oil, and we can produce much more.&nbsp; The leases are in place; the permits are available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, actually, it&#8217;s a time for oil and gas companies to work with Wall Street to unleash our productive capacity.&nbsp; Price signals are giving every incentive that producers need to invest in America&#8217;s energy security, our energy reliability, our energy sustainability.&nbsp; And that will cut our vulnerability to tyrants like Putin that influence global oil prices and gas prices at home.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s time to end that influence.&nbsp; And I can assure you our allies and partners around the world fully agree with us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this action alone, I want to emphasize once more: We are we are not a major importer of Russian oil, but we are a major producer of energy at home.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to &#8212; sorry, I&#8217;m trying to make sure that I get the most range.&nbsp; Let’s do James Politi from the Financial Times, please.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thank you so much.&nbsp; Just a quick question.&nbsp; Would the U.S. support imposing secondary sanctions on Russian oil and energy products even though the Europeans haven&#8217;t kind of gone along with the initial ban?</p>



<p>And can you &#8212; we saw that the UK came out in support of the &#8212; of a winddown, basically, of their Russian oil purchases.&nbsp; Have you been discussing this with Japan as well?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Hi, James.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been discussing this action extensively with all of our partners, and not just those in Europe, but also our G7 partners and partners and allies beyond the G7.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what&#8217;s clear not just from those conversations, but from conversations over a longer period of time, is that countries are in different circumstances.&nbsp; And the United States is particularly capable of taking this action given the level of imports from Russia, in energy, and the amount of production of energy at home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not all countries are in the same circumstance, and we recognize that.&nbsp; They&#8217;re going to have to make their own evaluation.&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t seen specifically what the UK has done.&nbsp; I know they&#8217;ve announced something in this area, but I have not seen the specifics, James.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I expect that as countries do their analysis and as they consider their options, we&#8217;ll hear from them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But again, we are in a &#8212; we know that we are in very different circumstances than most of our allies and partners across the world.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; And, sorry, James, can you repeat your first question?&nbsp; [Senior administration official], I don&#8217;t know if you answered that one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just had a quick question on secondary sanctions.&nbsp; I saw on the factsheet that the U.S. is banning Americans from basically doing anything to finance investments in the Russian energy sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Oh, I see.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; I mean, I was answering your question on secondary sanctions by saying, you know, we recognize other countries are in different circumstances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But with respect to the provision that you&#8217;re mentioning, James, this is the clause that essentially says Americans are going to be prohibited from participating in foreign investments that flow into Russia&#8217;s energy sector.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a foreign consortium that&#8217;s putting money into Russia&#8217;s energy sector.&nbsp; Americans cannot participate in that consortium.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Does that make sense?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, that makes sense.&nbsp; I know they&#8217;re two slightly separate issues, but that clarifies it.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s &#8212; not only can Americans not invest directly in Russia&#8217;s energy sector, they also can’t participate in foreign investments that are going into Russia&#8217;s energy sector.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s do &#8212; I think we have time for probably a couple more.&nbsp; So can we do Ed Lawrence from Fox News, please?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, yeah.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thanks for doing this.&nbsp; Just a quick clarification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So you were saying that the best way to get oil prices and gas prices down globally is to speed up the transition to clean energy.&nbsp; So are you saying that Americans should expect to deal with higher gas prices for &#8212; you know, until 2030, when we get off &#8212; when the administration is looking at that net zero?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Oh, not at all.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a transition.&nbsp; And to make that transition as orderly as possible, we need to continue to work with major energy consumers around the world to consider releasing reserves to ensure stable energy supplies.&nbsp; We need to continue working with major energy producers across the world that have spare capacity to produce more.&nbsp; And we need our domestic oil and gas industry to use their leases, use their permits, use financing from Wall Street to respond to price signals and continue increasing their production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a time for Wall Street to step up, for oil and gas companies to step up and invest in America&#8217;s energy future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just quickly, as a follow: Is there a timeline, then, you&#8217;re looking at for when Americans can see gas prices come back down based on all the things the administration is doing now?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Well, that &#8212; I can&#8217;t give you a prediction because much of what you&#8217;re seeing in energy markets right now is the result of Putin&#8217;s aggression and his brutal war.&nbsp; And I can&#8217;t get into his mind and give you a prediction on what he&#8217;ll do next, but we&#8217;re ready for anything.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; And I think we have time for one more, so let&#8217;s do Aurelia from AFP, please.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Thank you so much for doing this.&nbsp; I have two related questions.&nbsp; You said the United States did not ask Europeans to take this step.&nbsp; Are there European countries that asked you not to &#8212; not to take this step?</p>



<p>And maybe a broader question.&nbsp; Looking forward, as you say, all countries have different circumstances.&nbsp; So do you expect it to become more difficult for all allies to find common ground for the next sanctions, the next steps?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, no, I would say there is still remarkable &#8212; I mean, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s an overstatement to say historic unity across the world, in terms of our willingness and our resolve to impose the most severe set of economic costs that have ever been imposed on a country as large as Russia.</p>



<p>If you did &#8212; I think, actually, it was Bloomberg that added up the number of sanctions that have been imposed on Russia.&nbsp; And if you look at the breadth and the number, it&#8217;s remarkable how unified the whole world is to stand up to what Putin is doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So that&#8217;s the sentiment.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the &#8212; that&#8217;s the type of discussion that&#8217;s been taking place in general and specifically with regard to the step we&#8217;re announcing today.</p>



<p>And I don&#8217;t want to speak for other countries.&nbsp; They&#8217;re going to have &#8212; you know, they&#8217;re all evaluating their circumstances with different tools and different authorities.&nbsp; We&#8217;re all imposing the most severe costs on Russia and the most severe financial sanctions that have ever been imposed in economic history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m going to let [senior administration official] go.&nbsp; And thanks, everyone, for joining on short notice.&nbsp; If we did not get to your question, please reach out to Vedant and I, and we will make sure to get back to you.&nbsp; And thanks again for your time.</p>



<p>As reminder, this call was on background, so if you joined late: background, senior administration official.&nbsp; And the embargo has now lifted.</p>



<p>Thanks, everyone. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Roosevelt Room</p>



<p>11:25 A.M. EST   <br> <br>THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning, folks.  Sorry to keep you waiting.  I was on a couple of phone calls.  <br> <br>Today I’m announcing the United States is targeting the main artery of Russia’s economy.  <br> <br>We’re banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy.<br> <br>That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at U.S. ports, and the American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin’s war machine.<br> <br>This is a move that has strong bipartisan support in the Congress and, I believe, in the country.<br> <br>Americans have rallied support &#8212; have rallied to support the Ukrainian people and made it clear we will not be part of subsidizing Putin’s war.<br> <br>This made &#8212; we made this decision in close consultation with our Allies and our partners around the world, particularly in Europe, because a united response to Putin’s aggression has been my overriding focus, to keep all NATO and all of the EU and our allies totally united.<br> <br>We’re moving forward on this ban, understanding that many of our European Allies and partners may not be in a position to join us. <br> <br>The United States produces far more oil domestically than all of European &#8212; all the European countries combined.  In fact, we’re a net exporter of energy.  So we can take this step when others cannot.<br> <br>But we’re working closely with Europe and our partners to develop a long-term strategy to reduce their dependence on Russian energy as well.<br> <br>Our teams are actively discussing how to make this happen.  And today, we remain united &#8212; we remain united in our purpose to keep pressure mounting on Putin and his war machine.<br> <br>This is a step that we’re taking to inflict further pain on Putin.  But there will be costs as well here in the United States.  I said I would level with the American people from the beginning.  And when I first spoke to this, I said defending freedom is going to cost &#8212; it’s going to cost us as well, in the United States.<br> <br>Republicans and Democrats understand &#8212; alike understand that.  Republicans and Democrats alike have been clear that we must do this.  <br> <br>Over the last week, I’ve spoken with President Zelenskyy several times to hear from him about the situation on the ground and to consult and continuing to consult with our European allies and &#8212; about U.S. support for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.<br> <br>Thus far, we’ve provided more than $1 billion in security assistance to Ukraine.  Shipments of defensive weapons are arriving in Ukraine every day from the United States.  And we, the United States, are the ones coordinating the delivery of our Allies and partners of similar weapons, from Germany to Finland to the Netherlands.  We’re accom- &#8212; we’re &#8212; we’re working that out. <br> <br>We’re also providing humanitarian support for the Ukrainian people, both those still in Ukraine and those who have fled safely to a neighboring country. <br> <br>We’re working with humanitarian organizations to surge tens of thousands of tons of food, water, and medical supplies into Ukraine, and with more on the way.<br> <br>Over the weekend, I sent Secretary Blinken to visit our border between &#8212; the border Poland and Ukraine and to Moldova to see what the situation was firsthand and report back.<br> <br>General Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of our Defense Department, is also &#8212; was also in Europe, meeting with his counterparts and Allies on NATO’s eastern flank to reassure them &#8212; those countries bordering Russia, NATO countries &#8212; that we will keep our NATO commitment &#8212; a sacred commitment to Article &#8212; of Article 5.<br> <br>The Vice President Harris is going to be traveling to meet with our allies in Poland and Romania later this week as well.<br> <br>I’ve made it clear that the United States will share in the responsibility of caring for the refugees so the costs do not fall entirely on the European countries bordering Ukraine.<br> <br>And yesterday I spoke with my counterparts from France, Germany, and the United Kingdom about Russia’s escalating violence against Ukraine and the steps that we’re going to take together with our Allies and partners around the world to respond to this aggression.<br> <br>We are enforcing the most significant package of economic sanctions in history, and it’s causing significant damage to Russia’s economy. <br> <br>It has caused the Russian economy to, quite frankly, crater.  The Russian ruble is now down to 50 percent &#8212; by 50 percent since Putin announced his war.  One ruble is now worth less than one American penny.  One ruble is less than one American penny.<br>    <br>And preventing Russia’s Central Bank from propping up the ruble and to keep its value up.  They’re not going to be able to do that now.<br> <br>We cut Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system, and it’s crippled their ability to do business with the rest of the world.  <br> <br>In addition, we’re choking off Russia’s access to technology, like semiconductors that are &#8212; and sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.<br> <br>Major companies are pulling out of Russia entirely, without even being asked &#8212; not by us.  Over the weekend, Visa, Mastercard, American Express &#8212; they all suspended their services in Russia.  All of them.<br> <br>Joining a growing list of American and global companies from Ford to Nike to Apple, they’ve suspended their operations in Russia.<br> <br>The U.S. stock exchange has halted trading of many Russian securities.  And the private sector is standing united against Russia’s vicious war of choice. <br> <br>The U.S. Department of Justice has assembled a dedicated task force to go after Russian &#8212; the crimes of Russian oligarchs.<br> <br>And we’re joining with our European allies to find and seize their yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets, and all their ill-begotten gains to make sure they share in the pain of Putin’s war. <br> <br>These, by the way, are giant yachts.  You put some of them in your press.  I mean, some of them are &#8212; I think I read one was over 400 feet long.  I mean, it’s &#8212; this is worth hundreds of millions of dollars.<br> <br>The decision today is not without cost here at home.  Putin’s war is already hurting American families at the gas pump. <br> <br>Since Putin began his military buildup on Ukrainian borders, just since then, the price of the gas at the pump in America went up 75 cents.  And with this action, it’s going to go up further.<br> <br>I’m going to do everything I can to minimize Putin’s price hike here at home.  In coordination with our partners, we&#8217;ve already announced that we’re releasing 60 million barrels of oil from our joint oil reserves.  Half of that &#8212; 30 billion &#8212; million &#8212; excuse me &#8212; is coming from the United States.<br> <br>And we’re taking steps to ensure the reliable supply of global energy.<br> <br>And we’re also going to keep working with every tool at our disposal to protect American families and businesses.<br> <br>Now, let me &#8212; let me say this.  To the oil and gas companies and to the finance firms that back them: We understand Putin’s war against the people of Ukraine is causing prices to rise.  We get that.  That’s self-evident.  But &#8212; but, but, but &#8212; it’s no excuse to exercise excessive price increases or padding profits or any kind of effort to exploit this situation or Ameri- &#8212; or American consumers &#8212; exploit them.<br> <br>Russia’s aggression is costing us all, and it’s no time for profiteering or price gouging.<br> <br>I want to be clear about what we’ll not tolerate, but I also want to acknowledge those firms in oil and gas industries that are pulling out of Russia and joining other businesses that are leading by example.<br> <br>This is a time when we have to do our part and make sure we’re not taking &#8212; we’re not taking advantage.<br> <br>Look, let me be clear about two other points.  First, it’s simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production.  That’s simply not true.<br> <br>Even amid the pandemic, companies in the United States pumped more oil during my first year in office than they did during my predecessor’s first year.<br> <br>We’re approaching record levels of oil and gas production in the United States, and we’re on track to set a record of oil production next year. <br> <br>In the United States, 90 percent of onshore oil production takes place on land that isn’t owned by the federal government.  And of the remaining 10 percent that occurs on federal land, the oil and gas industry has millions of acres leased.  They have 9,000 permits to drill now.  They could be drilling right now, yesterday, last week, last year.  They have 9,000 to drill onshore that are already approved. <br> <br>So let me be clear &#8212; let me be clear: They are not using them for production now.  That’s their decision.  These are the facts.  We should be honest about the facts. <br> <br>Second, this crisis is a stark reminder: To protect our economy over the long term, we need to become energy independent.<br> <br>I&#8217;ve had numerous conversations over the last three months with our European friends of how they have to wean themselves off of Russia &#8212; Russian oil.  It’s just not &#8212; it’s just not tenable.<br> <br>It should motivate us to accelerate the transition to clean energy.  This is a perspective, as I said, that our European allies share and the &#8212; a future where together we can achieve greater independence.<br> <br>Loosening environmental regulations or pulling back clean energy investment won’t &#8212; let me explain &#8212; won’t &#8212; will not lower energy prices for families.  But transforming our economy to run on electric vehicles powered by clean energy with tax credits to help American families winterize their homes and use less energy, that will &#8212; that will help.<br> <br>And if we can &#8212; if we do what we can, it will mean that no one has to worry about the price at the gas pump in the future.<br> <br>That’ll mean tyrants like Putin won’t be able to use fossil fuels as weapons against other nations.<br> <br>And it will make America a world leader manufacturing and exporting clean energy technologies of the future to countries all around the world.  <br> <br>This is the goal we should be racing toward.<br> <br>Over the last two weeks, the Ukrainian people have inspired the world &#8212; and I mean that in a literal sense.  They’ve inspired the world with their bravery, their patriotism, their defiant determination to live free.<br> <br>Putin’s war &#8212; Putin’s war has caused enormous suffering and needless loss of life of women, children, everyone in Ukraine &#8212; both Ukraine and, I might add, Russians. <br> <br>Ukrainian leaders, as well as leaders around the world, have repeatedly called for a ceasefire, for humanitarian relief, for real diplomacy.  But Putin seems determined to continue on his murderous path no matter the cost. <br> <br>Putin is now targeting cities and has been targeting cities and civilians &#8212; schools, hospitals, apartment buildings.<br> <br>Last week, he attacked the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, with an apparent disregard for the potential of triggering a nuclear meltdown. <br> <br>He has already turned 2 million Ukrainians into refugees.<br> <br>Russia may continue to grind out its advance at a horrible price, but this much is already clear: Ukraine will never be a victory for Putin.<br> <br>Putin may be able to take a city, but he’ll never be able to hold the country.  And if we do not respond to Putin’s assault on global peace and stability today, the cost of freedom and to the American people will be even greater tomorrow.  <br> <br>So we’re going to continue to support the brave Ukrainian people as they fight for their country.  And I call on Congress to pass the $12 billion Ukraine assistance package that I have asked them for of late. <br> <br>The Ukrainian people are demonstrating by their physical courage that they are not about to just let Putin take what he wants.  That’s clear.  They’ll defend their freedom, their democracy, their lives. <br> <br>And we’re going to keep providing security assistance, economic assistance, and humanitarian assistance.  We’re going to support them against tyranny, oppression, violent acts of subjugation. <br> <br>People everywhere &#8212; and I think it’s maybe even surprised some of you all &#8212; people everywhere are speaking up for freedom.  And when the history of this war is written, Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.<br> <br>May God bless all those heroes of Ukraine.  And now I&#8217;m off to Texas.  Thank you very, very much. <br> <br>(Cross-talk by reporters.)<br> <br>I know there&#8217;s a lot of que- &#8212;<br> <br>Q    Mr. President, will you cut off trade with Russia? Will you cut off trade with Russia?<br> <br>THE PRESIDENT:  I know &#8212; I know there&#8217;s a lot of questions, but there&#8217;s a lot more that has to be made clear.  And I&#8217;m going to hold on that until we get more information.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.<br> <br>11:37 A.M. EST</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, the White House released a new state-by-state analysis of the historic tax relief for working families in President Biden’s American Rescue Plan (ARP), which is helping lower costs for families and workers. Thanks to ARP, Americans have received the largest ever Child Tax Credit, the largest ever Earned Income Tax Credit for workers without dependent children, and the largest ever Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit – which will help families meet the high costs of care.<br><br>The American Rescue Plan:<br><br><strong>Expanded Child Tax Credit for Working Families – Helping Deliver Record Lows in Child Poverty.</strong></p>



<ul><li>The 2021 CTC will reach a <strong>record nearly 40 million families with 65 million children.</strong></li><li>Expanded $3,000 credit for kids age 6-17 and $3,600 for kids under 6</li><li>Experts estimate that the <strong>Child Tax Credit was the main driver in the American Rescue Plan bringing child poverty to record lows in 2021</strong>– including record low Black and Hispanic child poverty.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit for Workers</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong><u>Tripled EITC for 17 million workers without dependent children</u></strong> from $540 to $1500 – first increase since 1993 – and extended the credit to younger &amp; older workers.</li><li><strong><u>Helping millions of front-line workers:</u> </strong>This expansion will help nearly 1.8 million cashiers and retail salespeople; almost 1 million cooks and food prep workers; and more than 850,000 nurses and health aides, 500,000 janitors, 400,000 truck and delivery drivers, and 300,000 childcare workers.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Delivered a historic increase in the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit to support for millions of working families this tax season</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong><em><u>ARP increased maximum CDCTC by more than 6 times</u></em></strong> to up to $8,000 towards child care expenses in 2021 for a median income family with two children under age 13 (compared with a maximum of $1,200 in 2020).</li><li><strong><em><u>Will reimburse most families for up to half of their child care expenses</u></em></strong> (was only up to 20 percent of expenses in 2020 for most families)</li><li><strong><em><u>First time fully-refundable</u></em></strong>, making the credit fairer regardless of taxes owed.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, President Biden will sign an Executive Order (E.O.) to ban the import of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas, and coal to the United States – a significant action with widespread bipartisan support that will further deprive President Putin of the economic resources he uses to continue his needless war of choice.</p>



<p>The United States made this decision in close consultation with our Allies and partners around the world, as well as Members of Congress of both parties. The United States is able to take this step because of our strong domestic energy infrastructure and we recognize that not all of our Allies and partners are currently in a position to join us. But we are united with our Allies and partners in working together to reduce our collective dependence on Russian energy and keep the pressure mounting on Putin, while at the same taking active steps to limit impacts on global energy markets and protect our own economies.</p>



<p>This announcement builds on unprecedented economic costs the United States and our Allies and partners have imposed on Russia. As a result of our historic, multilateral coordination, Russia has become a global economic and financial pariah. Over 30 countries representing well over half the world’s economy have announced sanctions that impose immediate and severe economic costs on Russia, cut off access to high-tech technology, sap its growth potential, and weaken its military for years to come. The Russian ruble is now worth less than a penny and has hit an all-time low after losing almost half of its value since Putin announced his further invasion of Ukraine. By isolating Russia’s Central Bank and cutting off the largest Russian banks from the international financial system, we have disarmed his war chest of foreign reserves and left Putin to soften the blow of our sanctions. U.S. and allied export controls are impacting industrial production in Russia, Russian commercial aviation, and other key sectors of the Russian economy. The United States and governments all over the world are going after Putin’s cronies and their families by identifying and freezing the assets they hold in our respective jurisdictions – their yachts, luxury apartments, money, and other ill-gotten gains.<br></p>



<p><strong>Today’s Executive Order bans:</strong></p>



<ul><li>The importation into the United States of Russian crude oil and certain petroleum products, liquefied natural gas, and coal. Last year, the U.S. imported nearly 700,000 barrels per day of crude oil and refined petroleum products from Russia and this step will deprive Russia of billions of dollars in revenues from U.S. drivers and consumers annually.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>New U.S. investment in Russia’s energy sector, which will ensure that American companies and American investors are not underwriting Vladimir Putin’s efforts to expand energy production inside Russia.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Americans will also be prohibited from financing or enabling foreign companies that are making investment to produce energy in Russia.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Putin’s brutal war has led to higher energy prices and raised costs for Americans at home. Today, President Biden made clear that he will keep working to mitigate the pain American families feel at the pump and reduce our dependence on foreign oil and fossil fuels:</strong></p>



<ul><li>The Administration has already committed to releasing more than 90 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve this fiscal year, with an emergency sale of 30 million barrels announced just last week.&nbsp;After intensive around-the-clock coordination and consultation by President Biden, the International Energy Agency (IEA) Member countries agreed to a collective release of an initial 60 million barrels of crude oil from our strategic petroleum reserves, with the United States committing half of that in the emergency sale. We are in conversations with a range of energy producers and consumers on further steps we can take to ensure a stable global supply of energy.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>U.S. oil and gas production is approaching record highs, while thousands of drilling permits on federal lands go unused.&nbsp;Federal policies are not limiting the production of oil and gas.&nbsp; To the contrary, the Biden Administration has been clear that in the short-term, supply must keep up with demand, at home and around the world while we make the shift to a secure clean energy future. &nbsp;We are one of the world’s largest producers with a strong domestic oil and gas industry. Natural gas production has never been higher, and crude oil production is expected to hit a new high next year. Oil and gas companies, and the finance firms that back them, should not use Putin’s war as an excuse for excess price increases or padding profits, and, as major energy company leaders have themselves said, they have the resources and incentives they need to further increase production in the United States.</li></ul>



<ul><li>In the long run, the way to avoid high gas prices is to speed up – not slow down – our transition to a clean energy future.&nbsp; We cannot drill our way out of dependence on a global commodity controlled in part by foreign nations and their leaders, including Putin. The only way to eliminate Putin’s and every other producing country’s ability to use oil as an economic weapon, is to reduce our dependency on oil.&nbsp; So, even as President Biden does everything in his power in the short term to make sure we can readily access the oil and gas necessary to protect American consumers and allied countries– including through greater U.S. domestic production that is expected to hit record highs next year – this crisis reinforces our resolve to make America truly energy independent, which means reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. This is a shared goal with our European allies, that we will work together to achieve.</li></ul>

<p>One year ago today, on International Women’s Day, President Biden issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/08/executive-order-on-establishment-of-the-white-house-gender-policy-council/">Executive Order</a> establishing the White House Gender Policy Council and charged it with leading a government-wide effort to advance gender equity and equality both at home and abroad. &nbsp;<br><br>In the year since, the Biden-Harris Administration laid out an ambitious agenda in the first-ever <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/National-Strategy-on-Gender-Equity-and-Equality.pdf">National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality</a> and has taken significant steps to advance equal rights and opportunity: &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Expanded Economic Opportunity and Supported Women in the Workforce</strong></p>



<ul><li>Provided immediate relief through the <strong>American Rescue Plan (ARP)</strong>&nbsp;to millions of women who have borne the brunt of the pandemic, including by: standing up a historic vaccination program that has resulted in more than 215 million people in the United States being fully vaccinated; reopening schools; providing direct payments to individuals; expanding nutrition programs for families; helping child care providers keep their doors open; providing paid leave tax credits for small and midsize employers; distributing the majority of emergency rental assistance to female-headed households; and expanding&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-whole-of-government-effort-to-ensure-child-tax-credit-reaches-all-eligible-families/">Child Tax Credit</a>, which last year contributed to the largest drop in child poverty in American history.<br></li><li>Passed the <strong>Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)</strong>, which will increase access to good-paying jobs, including for women, people of color, and members of other communities who are currently underrepresented in the sectors where these jobs will be created, such as transportation, clean energy, and broadband. It will also replace lead pipes, and expand affordable high-speed internet, reliable public transit, and clean drinking water. BIL also established a task force, soon to be launched by the Department of Transportation and the Department of Labor, dedicated to promoting the recruitment, inclusion, and advancement of women in trucking.<br></li><li>Issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/04/27/executive-order-on-increasing-the-minimum-wage-for-federal-contractors/">Executive Order</a> to <strong>increase the minimum wage and eliminate the subminimum wage for federal contractors</strong>, which went into effect in January 2022 and ensures that Federal contractors pay their workers an hourly wage of at least $15.00. This significantly benefits women, who are disproportionately minimum wage workers.<br></li><li>Issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/22/executive-order-protecting-the-federal-workforce/">Executive Order on Protecting the Federal Workforce</a>, which directs the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to provide a report to the President with recommendations to <strong>promote a $15 per hour minimum wage for federal employees. </strong><a href="https://chcoc.gov/content/achieving-15-hour-minimum-pay-rate-federal-employees">OPM</a> then issued a memorandum implementing guidance for agencies to do so.<br></li><li>Issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/25/executive-order-on-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce/">Executive Order </a>&nbsp;to promote <strong>diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility</strong> across the federal government – the nation’s largest employer – including by prioritizing efforts to close gender and racial wage gaps, address workplace safety and harassment, including in our national security workforce, and advance equity for LGBTQI+ public servants.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Prevented and Responded to Gender-Based Violence</strong></p>



<ul><li>Directed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/10/25/hhs-announces-nearly-800-million-american-rescue-plan-funds-support-domestic-violence-sexual-assault-survivors-their-children.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1 billion in supplemental funding</a>&nbsp;for <strong>domestic violence and sexual assault services </strong>through the American Rescue Plan, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/fysb/grant-funding/2021-fvpsa-american-rescue-plan-culturally-specific-program-instruction-guidance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$49.5 million for culturally-specific community-based organizations</a>&nbsp;that help survivors from historically marginalized communities access the services and support they need. The ARP also provided approximately 70,000 housing choice vouchers to local Public Housing Authorities in order to assist individuals and families, including those who are fleeing, or attempting to flee, from domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or human trafficking.&nbsp;<br></li><li>Working with Congress to reauthorize and strengthen the bipartisan <strong>Violence Against Women Act (</strong>VAWA), which passed the House in March 2021 and has been introduced in the Senate. The President has continued to champion this legislation, an expanded version of the bill he first wrote and passed as a United States Senator in 1994. In addition, the President’s discretionary budget request for FY22 doubles funding for Department of Justice VAWA programs, with a historic $1 billion investment in total funding.<br></li><li>Signed into law&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/27/statement-by-the-president-on-s-1605-the-national-defense-authorization-act-for-fiscal-year-2022/">National Defense Authorization Act</a>, which included <strong>sweeping reforms to the military justice system</strong> – the most significant since the Uniform Code of Military Justice was established more than seventy years ago.&nbsp;In conjunction with the President’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/01/26/executive-order-on-2022-amendments-to-the-manual-for-courts-martial-united-states/">Executive Order</a> on military justice reform, this bipartisan, historic law adopts core recommendations of&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/02/statement-of-president-joe-biden-on-the-results-of-the-independent-review-commission-on-military-sexual-assault/">Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault</a>, as called for by President Biden. These reforms will fundamentally shift how the military prosecutes and investigates sexual assault, domestic violence, sexual harassment, and other serious crimes, and will increase prevention initiatives and support for survivors.&nbsp;All of these actions carry forward the President’s campaign promise to address the scourge of sexual assault in our armed forces.<br></li><li>Signed into law the <strong>Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act </strong>of 2021 – bipartisan legislation that empowers survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment by giving them a choice to go to court instead of being forced into arbitration.<br></li><li>Directed the Department of Education to <strong>review Title IX regulations</strong> and other agency actions to ensure that all students have an educational environment that is free from discrimination on the basis of sex. &nbsp;The Department is developing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking currently under review that will address the need for protection for students who experience campus sexual assault while treating all students fairly and addressing the issue of discrimination for LGBTQI+ students.<br></li><li>Signed into law the <strong>Amendments to the Victims of Crime Act</strong> (VOCA), which passed Congress with strong bipartisan support and expands the allocation of resources for the Crime Victims Fund. This has already resulted in an increase of hundreds of millions of dollars of non-taxpayer funding for essential and lifesaving services to crime victims around the country.<br></li><li>Announced the development of the first-ever government-wide <strong>National Action Plan to End Gender-Based Violence</strong>, as well as committed to reviewing and updating the 2016 United States Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally.<br></li><li>Issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/11/15/executive-order-on-improving-public-safety-and-criminal-justice-for-native-americans-and-addressing-the-crisis-of-missing-or-murdered-indigenous-people/">Executive Order</a> to improve public safety and criminal justice for Native Americans and <strong>address the crisis of missing or murdered Indigenous people</strong>, directing federal agencies to develop a coordinated strategy to prevent and respond to violence against Native Americans, which disproportionately affects Native women, girls, LGBTQI+ Native Americans and people who identify as “Two-Spirit.”<br></li><li>Re-launched the United States&#8217; leadership and participation in the<strong> Trilateral Working Group on Violence Against Indigenous Women and Girls </strong>with the Governments of Mexico and Canada. The White House will host the Fourth Convening of the Trilateral Working Group this summer to improve and reaffirm our respective national and regional commitments to prevent and respond to violence against Indigenous women and girls through increased access to justice and prevention services.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Expanded Access to Health Care, including Reproductive Health Care</strong></p>



<ul><li>The American Rescue Plan expanded premium tax credits, reduced net premiums, increased individuals’ savings, and <strong>provided women with access to quality, affordable health care coverage</strong> through the Marketplaces. Fifty-four percent of those newly signing up for coverage during 2021 special enrollment were women.<br></li><li>Issued&nbsp;a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/28/memorandum-on-protecting-womens-health-at-home-and-abroad/">Presidential Memorandum</a> to protect and expand access to comprehensive reproductive health care&nbsp;and to <strong>revoke the Mexico City policy</strong> – the “global gag” rule – that prohibited federal funding for foreign nongovernmental organizations providing abortion counseling or referrals, and restored funding to the UN Population Fund, which supports the provision of sexual and reproductive health services in fragile contexts.<br></li><li>Charged the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) with reviewing the Title X Rule to ensure that low-income people can access family planning and other preventive health care. HHS has since issued <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/10/04/hhs-issues-final-regulation-aimed-at-ensuring-access-to-equitable-affordable-client-centered-quality-family-planning-services.html">a final rule</a> to&nbsp;<strong>strengthen the Title X family planning program</strong>, carrying forward the Administration’s commitment to restore access to affordable, quality family planning services.<br></li><li>Took steps to <strong>improve maternal health and eliminate racial disparities </strong>that persist through efforts to reduce complications and mortality, which disproportionately impact Black and Indigenous women.&nbsp; Through the ARP, the Administration gives states an easier pathway to extend coverage for pregnant women from 60 days to 12 months postpartum; the Administration is working to encourage all states to take up this option so women can get the care they need to stay healthy and has approved Medicaid demonstration projects in several states to expand postpartum coverage. The Vice President hosted the first-ever <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/07/fact-sheet-vice-president-kamala-harris-announces-call-to-action-to-reduce-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/">White House Maternal Health Day of Action</a>, while the President issued the first-ever proclamation on Black Maternal Health Week, highlighting the specific disparities that Black women face in pregnancy and childbirth. &nbsp;As part of this call to action, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services issued new guidance to help states provide 12 months (up from 60 days currently) of continuous postpartum coverage through their Medicaid programs. HHS also announced plans to create a new “Birthing Friendly” hospital designation, which would be the first-ever hospital quality designation by HHS specifically focused on maternity care.<br></li><li>Launched <strong>a whole-of-government effort to protect women’s reproductive rights</strong> in the wake of the passage of an extreme and unconstitutional Texas law that severely impairs access to abortion after six weeks. In response, HHS issued Title X grant support for health service providers and announced additional funding to a current Title X family planning grantee in Texas, along with other actions.<br></li><li>In addition, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has vigorously pursued a legal challenge to the Texas law, and the Attorney General reaffirmed DOJ’s commitment to continuing to protect those seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services, including abortion, pursuant to its enforcement of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act.

The Administration is also integrating a focus on gender in preventing conflict, supporting peace-building, and promoting regional stability and security in partnership with countries facing a variety of stressors, such as climate change and backsliding democracy.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Promoted Diverse Leadership and Full Participation</strong></p>



<ul><li>Reached <strong>gender parity in the Cabinet</strong> for the first time ever, thanks to President Biden’s commitment to making diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility a priority in appointments to the Cabinet and across the federal government.&nbsp; The President has appointed a record number of women and people of color – including the first woman to serve as Treasury Secretary, the first woman to serve as Director of National Intelligence, the first Native American woman to serve in the Cabinet, and the first openly transgender, Senate-confirmed federal official.&nbsp;<br></li><li>Nominated the first Black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court and nominated more Black women to the Courts of Appeals than any previous President. And in his first year in office, President Biden has had more lower-court judicial nominees confirmed than any president since Kennedy.<br></li><li>Expressed <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/27/statement-from-president-biden-on-the-equal-rights-amendment/">steadfast support</a> for the <strong>Equal Rights Amendment</strong> and called on Congress to enshrine the principle of gender equality in the Constitution.

<p><strong>Advanced equality for transgender Americans</strong> by signing an Executive Order to restore open service for transgender service members, expanding access to comprehensive gender-affirming medical care for transgender veterans, delivering more inclusive federal IDs like passports for transgender and non-binary people, and addressing anti-transgender violence, which continues to disproportionately impact trans women and girls of color.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Built the architecture to ensure <strong>a government-wide, intersectional approach</strong> to advancing equal rights and opportunities by:<ul><li>Issuing the first-ever <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/National-Strategy-on-Gender-Equity-and-Equality.pdf">National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality</a>, which addresses ten priorities – including economic security, education, health, human rights, democracy and leadership. It also reflects the Administration&#8217;s broader commitment to advancing equity, including through racial equity and LGBTQI+ equality.</li><li>Issuing an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/">Executive Order</a> on advancing racial equity and support for underserved communities and an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-preventing-and-combating-discrimination-on-basis-of-gender-identity-or-sexual-orientation/">Executive Order</a> on preventing and combatting discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>In the past year, the Biden-Harris Administration has produced historic results. As the President said in his State of the Union address, “We are stronger today than we were a year ago…and we will be stronger a year from now than we are today.”<br><br>Going forward, the Administration remains committed to helping women get back to work; creating good jobs; closing gender and racial wage gaps; lowering costs for families; ensuring that care is accessible and affordable – including child care, home health care and paid leave; expanding access to health care, including reproductive health care; advancing LGBTQI+ equality and civil rights; and preventing and responding to gender-based violence, wherever it occurs.<br><br>In doing so, we will continuing our extensive engagement with domestic and international partners, which in the last year has included collaborating with nonprofit and community-based organizations, civil society groups, faith-based organizations, unions, worker organizations and academics; engaging over 270 girls, young women and gender nonconforming youth leaders from across the United States and more than dozen countries to provide input into the development of the National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality; and hosting a historic White House roundtable with intersex advocates. We look forward to continuing this collaboration in the years ahead, in service of our vision of a world where people of all genders are guaranteed the equity, equality, and dignity they deserve.</p>

<p>From soft lullabies to battle cries for justice, women nurse and nurture, teach and build, lead and dream our world forward each and every day.</p>



<p>Women have never been silent, but women have been silenced. That’s because our voices are powerful. When we raise them, we can tear down injustice, topple tyrants and demagogues and shatter the shields of oppression.</p>



<p>This International Women’s Day, we honor women throughout the world who courageously use their voice, no matter the cost.</p>



<p>To our sisters from Ukraine who are fighting to keep their country free and their families alive: We stand with you in solidarity.</p>



<p>To our sisters in Russia who are protesting and speaking out against the invasion at great personal risk: We see your courage.</p>



<p>To women warriors around the world, those fighting for justice and working for change: Thank you for building a better future for all of us.</p>

<p>On International Women’s Day, we recognize the achievements of women and girls in the United States and across the globe, celebrate the progress we’ve made, and recommit ourselves to the work that remains to deliver the full measure of equity, dignity, and opportunity due to all women and girls.</p>



<p>Every person deserves the chance to live up to their full God-given potential, without regard for gender or other factors.&nbsp; Ensuring that every woman and girl has that chance isn’t just the right thing to do — it’s also a strategic imperative that advances the prosperity, stability, and security of our nation and the world.&nbsp; Yet too often, in too many places, women and girls face obstacles that limit their possibilities and undermine their participation in economic, political, and social life.&nbsp; These barriers have been exposed and exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which disproportionately affected women’s labor force participation, elevated the burden on both paid and unpaid caregivers, and increased the incidence of gender-based violence.</p>



<p>Improving the status of women and girls strengthens economies, democracies, and societies across the board.&nbsp; That’s why I made gender equity a cornerstone of my Administration by creating the White House Gender Policy Council shortly after taking office a year ago.&nbsp; It’s why we issued the first-ever National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality — an ambitious agenda to support women and families through both domestic and foreign policy.&nbsp; It’s why we’ve invested in child care and supported women’s economic opportunity through the American Rescue Plan; fought to reauthorize and strengthen the Violence Against Women Act; addressed the scourge of sexual assault in the military through sweeping military justice reforms; signed the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act into law; launched a whole-of-government effort to protect reproductive rights; advanced women’s participation in conflict prevention and resolution, stability and security; and created a Gender Equity and Equality Action Fund to promote the economic security of women around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; And it’s why I’m proud that my FY 2023 Budget will request $2.6 billion for foreign assistance programs that promote gender equality worldwide, more than doubling the amount requested for gender programs last year.</p>



<p>On this day and every day, let us recognize that all of us have a better future when women and girls can reach their full potential — and together, let’s renew our efforts to advance dignity, equality, and limitless possibilities for all.</p>
