<p>Throughout the pandemic, preventing evictions and keeping people in their homes has been a proven way of slowing the spread of COVID-19.</p>



<p>The Administration believes that CDC’s new moratorium is a proper use of its lawful authority to protect the public health. We are pleased that the district court left the moratorium in place, though we are aware that further proceedings in this case are likely.</p>



<p>The President continues to call on State and local elected officials and judges to issue local eviction moratoriums and move aggressively to distribute the $46.5 billion in emergency rental assistance funds that are available through the bipartisan COVID relief act that Congress passed in December 2020, and through the President’s American Rescue Plan that was enacted in March 2021. And, the President calls on landlords to seek out rental assistance and not evict tenants from their homes, and echoes Attorney General Garland’s calls for state and local courts to implement policies to discourage eviction filings until landlords and tenants have sought emergency rental assistance funds.</p>

<p>One year ago, with the country at a crossroads, President Biden unveiled his Build Back Better Agenda. Facing a raging pandemic, unprecedented economic downturn, profound climate crisis, and persistent racial injustices, President Biden outlined an ambitious agenda that would position America not just to return to where we were, but to build back better towards a more sustainable, resilient, equitable, and prosperous future.<br><br>The Build Back Better Agenda includes President Biden’s American Families Plan and key elements of the American Jobs Plan that were not included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure and Investments Act. In Washington, this proposal is known as “reconciliation.” But the bottom line is a plan that will <strong><u>create jobs</u></strong>, <strong><u>cut taxes</u></strong>, and <strong><u>lower costs for working families</u></strong>—all paid for by making the tax code fairer and making the wealthiest and large corporations pay their fair share.<br><br><strong>LOWER COSTS<br><em>Lower Prescription Drug Costs.</em></strong> Americans pay 2-3 times more for their prescription drugs than people in other wealthy countries, and nearly <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/press-release/poll-nearly-1-in-4-americans-taking-prescription-drugs-say-its-difficult-to-afford-medicines-including-larger-shares-with-low-incomes/">1 in 4 Americans</a> struggle to afford prescription drugs. President Biden’s plan will lower prescription drug costs for Americans by letting Medicare negotiate drug prices, so consumers are no longer at the whim of pharmaceutical companies.<br><br><strong><em>Lower Child Care Costs.</em></strong> Rural children are <a href="https://earlylearningnation.com/2018/05/the-challenges-of-rural-pre-k/">less likely to be enrolled in pre-K programs</a> than urban and suburban children, and a third of rural children enter kindergarten without having attended pre-K. President Biden’s plan lowers child care costs and makes universal preschool a reality, providing parents access to high-quality programs in the setting of their choice. The Build Back Better Agenda would also institute 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, to help improve the health of new mothers and reduce wage loss.<br><br><strong><em>Lower Health Care Costs.</em></strong> More than <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/04/health-insurance-rural-america.html">12 percent of people living in completely rural counties</a> lacked health insurance before President Biden took office, coverage under the Affordable Care Act (even with the ACA’s premium subsidies) was too expensive for many families, and almost <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/the-coverage-gap-uninsured-poor-adults-in-states-that-do-not-expand-medicaid/">2.2 million people </a>were locked out of coverage because their state refused to expand Medicaid. President Biden’s plan lowers health care costs for those buying coverage through the ACA by extending the American Rescue Plan’s cost savings, providing premium relief that is lowering health insurance costs by an average of $50 per person per month for more than 9 million people.<br><br><strong><em>Lower Higher Education Costs. </em></strong>Education beyond high school is increasingly important to succeed in the 21<sup>st</sup> century economy, even as it has become unaffordable for too many families. The Build Back Better Agenda would provide two years of free community college—boosting the earnings of low-wage high school graduates by nearly $6,000 per year. President Biden’s plan also increases the maximum Pell Grant award by almost $1,500, and invests billions in subsidized tuition for low- and middle-income students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and minority-serving institutions.<br><br><strong><em>Lower Housing Costs</em>. </strong><a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/99045/rental_housing_for_a_21st_century_rural_america.pdf">One in four rural renters</a> pay over half their income in rent. The Plan’s investments help lower housing costs and increase the supply of affordable housing through tax credits and government financing, including constructing and rehabilitating more than one million sustainable rental housing units and more than 500,000 homes working families can afford. It will also make investments to preserve existing public housing as well as remove lead-based paint from housing units.<br><br><strong>CUT TAXES<br><em>Tax Cuts for Families with Children. </em></strong><a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/90556/eib-200.pdf#:~:text=The%20rural%20poverty%20rate%20was%2016.4%20percent%20in,2017%20but%20remained%20highest%20among%20racial%2Fethnic%20minority%20groups.">16.4 percent of rural people</a> fall below the poverty line, struggling to pay expenses like food, rent, health care and transportation for their families. President Biden’s plan will extend the Child Tax Credit expansion in the American Rescue Plan, lowering taxes for middle class families by providing <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ARP-Fact-Sheet-AAPI-Communities.pdf">the families of more than 66 million</a> kids and an estimated <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/expanding-child-tax-credit-and-earned-income-tax-credit-would-benefit-more">10.4 million rural residents </a>across the U.S. a major tax cut – benefitting 45 percent of children from rural areas.<br><br><strong><em>Tax Cuts for Workers Without Children.</em></strong> The President’s agenda permanently extends the American Rescue Plan’s increase to the Earned-Income Tax Credit from $543 to $1,502. This will benefit roughly 17 million low-wage workers, including cashiers, cooks, delivery drivers, food preparation workers, and child care providers.<br><br><strong>CREATE JOBS<br><em>Locally-Led Economic Development. </em></strong>Many rural economies continue to struggle with long-term job loss and economic transition. The President’s plan will create a new Rural Partnership Program to empower rural regions, including Tribal Nations and territories, with resources to attract, access, and leverage federal, private, and philanthropic resources; lead strategic and effective development projects; and create results that matter to communities.<br><br><strong><em>Workforce Training.</em></strong> The U.S. has chronically underinvested in workforce development, and millions of jobs have been going unfilled in growing sectors such as construction and health care. Through high-quality career and technical education pathways and Registered Apprenticeships, President Biden’s Build Back Better Agenda will invest in training programs that will prepare millions of American workers for high-quality jobs in growing sectors.<br><br><strong><em>Clean Energy Jobs. </em></strong>When President Biden thinks about climate change, he thinks jobs. To position the U.S. to tackle the climate crisis and advance environmental justice, the President’s plan would create good-paying, union jobs, establish an energy efficiency and clean energy standard, expand and extend clean energy and electric vehicle tax credits, and enlist a new Civilian Climate Corps. As part of the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, the Build Back Better Agenda would also restore American manufacturing with R&amp;D investments—including critical investments to compete on clean energy.<br><br><strong><em>Investments in Teachers and Schools. </em></strong>Even before the pandemic, our schools faced an estimated teacher shortage of 100,000, undermining the education of our children and students of color in particular. <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/education/tackling-teacher-and-principal-shortages-in-rural-areas.aspx">Rural teachers</a> have an average starting salary that is more than $7,000 less than their suburban counterparts. President Biden’s Build Back Better Agenda will upgrade school infrastructure, address teacher shortages and improve teacher preparation, expand free school meals to an additional 9.3 million children during the school year and help families purchase food during the summer.<br></p>

<p>One year ago, with the country at a crossroads, President Biden unveiled his Build Back Better Agenda. Facing a raging pandemic, unprecedented economic downturn, profound climate crisis, and persistent racial injustices, President Biden outlined an ambitious agenda that would position America not just to return to where we were, but to build back better towards a more sustainable, resilient, equitable, and prosperous future.<br><br>The Build Back Better Agenda includes President Biden’s American Families Plan and key elements of the American Jobs Plan that were not included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal. In Washington, this proposal is known as “reconciliation.” But the bottom line is a plan that will <strong><u>create jobs</u>, <u>cut taxes</u>, and <u>lower costs for working families</u></strong>—all paid for by making the tax code fairer and making the wealthiest and large corporations pay their fair share.<br><br><strong><u><strong>LOWER COSTS</strong></u></strong><br><strong><em>Lower Child Care Costs. </em></strong>For 57 percent of children under six, there are no good choices for child care where they live. Only 44 percent of four-year-olds are served by public preschool programs. Nearly four in five private sector workers have no access to paid family leave. The President’s plan would ensure that no middle-class family pays more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality child care up to age 5—and that working families most in need won’t pay anything—saving the average family $14,800 per year. President Biden will also make universal preschool a reality, partnering with states to offer every parent access to high-quality preschool for 3- and 4- year-olds in the setting of their choice. Fully implementing this investment is projected to benefit five million families and save the average American family $13,000 per year. And the Build Back Better Agenda would institute 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, to help improve the health of new mothers and reduce wage loss.<br><br><strong><em>Lower Higher Education Costs. </em></strong>Education beyond high school is increasingly important to succeed in the 21<sup>st</sup> century economy, even as it has become unaffordable for too many families. The Build Back Better Agenda would provide two years of free community college—boosting the earnings of low-wage high school graduates by nearly $6,000 per year. President Biden’s plan will also increase the maximum Pell Grant award by almost $1,500, and invest billions in subsidized tuition for low- and middle-income students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and minority-serving institutions. The plan also invests in evidence-based strategies to strengthen completion and retention rates at institutions that serve high numbers of low-income students, particularly community colleges.<br><br><strong><em>Lower Prescription Drug Costs.</em></strong> Americans pay 2-3 times more for their prescription drugs than people in other wealthy countries, and nearly <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/press-release/poll-nearly-1-in-4-americans-taking-prescription-drugs-say-its-difficult-to-afford-medicines-including-larger-shares-with-low-incomes/">1 in 4 Americans</a> struggle to afford prescription drugs. President Biden’s plan will lower prescription drug costs for Americans by letting Medicare negotiate drug prices, so consumers are no longer at the whim of pharmaceutical companies.<br><br><strong><em>Lower Health Care Costs.</em></strong> The Build Back Better Agenda would reduce health insurance premiums, saving 9 million people an average of $50 per person per month, and add dental, vision, and hearing coverage to Medicare. By closing the Medicaid gap for low-income Americans, the President’s plan would help 4 million uninsured people gain coverage. President Biden’s agenda would also expand home care for older and disabled Americans, while improving the jobs and the pay of the home care workers who care for them.<br><br><strong><em>Lower Housing Costs. </em></strong>Driven by the largest shortfall of new housing units in 50 years, rents and housing prices continue to increase—with some 10.5 million renters paying more than half their incomes in rent. The Build Back Better Agenda will use tax credits and government financing to bolster affordable and resilient housing, supporting the construction or rehabilitation of more than two million homes.<br><br><strong><u><span style="text-decoration: underline">CUT TAXES</span></u></strong><br><strong><em>Tax Cuts for Families with Children.</em></strong> One third of all adults with children struggle to pay their usual expenses. The American Rescue Plan increased the Child Tax Credit from $2,000 per child to $3,000 per child for children over six and $3,600 for children under six. The Build Back Better Agenda will extend the Child Tax Credit expansion in the American Rescue Plan, providing 39 million households and nearly 90 percent of American children a major tax cut and cutting child poverty nearly in half.<br><br><strong><em>Tax Cuts for Workers Without Children.</em></strong> The President’s agenda permanently extends the American Rescue Plan’s increase to the Earned-Income Tax Credit from $543 to $1,502. This will benefit roughly 17 million low-wage workers, including cashiers, cooks, delivery drivers, food preparation workers, and child care providers.<br><br><strong><u>CREATE JOBS</u></strong><br><strong><em>Workforce Training.</em></strong> The U.S. has chronically underinvested in workforce development, and millions of jobs have been going unfilled in growing sectors such as construction and health care.

President Biden’s Build Back Better Agenda will address teacher shortages and improve teacher preparation, including through teacher residencies and Grow Your Own programs that produce better outcomes and develop more teachers of color. It would expand free school meals to an additional 9.3 million children during the school year and help families purchase food during the summer. And the President’s plan also invests in upgrading school infrastructure, so that we have cutting-edge, energy-efficient, resilient school buildings with technology and labs that will prepare students for the jobs of the future.</p>

<p>One year ago, with the country at a crossroads, President Biden unveiled his Build Back Better Agenda. Facing a raging pandemic, unprecedented economic downturn, profound climate crisis, and persistent racial injustices, President Biden outlined an ambitious agenda that would position America not just to return to where we were, but to build back better towards a more sustainable, resilient, equitable, and prosperous future.<br><br>The Build Back Better Agenda includes President Biden’s American Families Plan and key elements of the American Jobs Plan that were not included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure and Investments Act. In Washington, this proposal is known as “reconciliation.” But the bottom line is a plan that will <strong><u>create jobs</u></strong>, <strong><u>cut taxes</u></strong>, and <strong><u>lower costs for working families</u></strong>—all paid for by making the tax code fairer and making the wealthiest and large corporations pay their fair share. President Biden and Vice President Harris have also repeatedly expressed their strong support for including immigration reform in upcoming reconciliation legislation to enable Dreamers, TPS recipients, farmworkers and essential workers to gain long-awaited pathways to citizenship. <br><br><strong>LOWER COSTS</strong><br><strong><em>Lower Prescription Drug Costs.</em></strong> Americans pay 2-3 times more for their prescription drugs than people in other wealthy countries, contributing to the fact that <a href="https://www.nashp.org/states-curb-racial-inequities-in-rx-drug-affordability-with-targeted-legislation/">Latino individuals use 10 to 40 percent fewer medications</a> than their White counterparts for the same illnesses. President Biden’s plan will lower prescription drug costs for Americans by letting Medicare negotiate drug prices, so consumers are no longer at the whim of pharmaceutical companies.<br><br><strong><em>Lower Child Care Costs.</em></strong> Only <a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/how-many-children-attend-preschool-us/">59.4 percent of all three- and four-year-old Hispanic children</a> are enrolled in preschool or kindergarten programs. President Biden’s plan lowers child care costs and makes universal preschool a reality, providing parents access to high-quality programs in the setting of their choice. The Build Back Better Agenda would also institute 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, to help improve the health of new mothers and reduce wage loss.<br><br><strong><em>Lower Health Care Costs.</em></strong> Almost <a href="https://www.kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/">10.9 million Hispanic people</a> were uninsured in 2019 before President Biden took office, coverage under the Affordable Care Act (even with the ACA’s premium subsidies) was too expensive for many families, and almost <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/taking-a-closer-look-at-characteristics-of-people-in-the-coverage-gap/">1.3 million people of color</a> were locked out of coverage because their state refused to expand Medicaid. President Biden’s plan lowers health care costs for those buying coverage through the ACA by extending the American Rescue Plan’s cost savings, which helps <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/pdf/265581/aspe-uninsured-trends-aapi-ib.pdf">730,000 Latino people </a>save an average of $50 per person per month, and allowing 580,000 uninsured Latinos to gain coverage. The plan also adds  dental, vision, and hearing coverage for the more than <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/state-indicator/medicare-beneficiaries-by-raceethnicity/?dataView=1&amp;currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D">5 million Hispanic people on Medicare</a> and closes the Medicaid gap for low-income Americans.<br><br><strong><em>Lower Higher Education Costs. </em></strong>Education beyond high school is increasingly important to succeed in the 21<sup>st</sup> century economy, even as it has become unaffordable for too many families. The Build Back Better Agenda would provide two years of free community college—boosting the earnings of low-wage high school graduates by nearly $6,000 per year. President Biden’s plan also increases the maximum Pell Grant award by almost $1,500, and invests billions in subsidized tuition for low- and middle-income students at minority-serving institutions. The plan also invests in evidence-based strategies to strengthen completion and retention rates at institutions that serve high numbers of low-income students, particularly community colleges.<br><br><strong><em>Lower Housing Costs</em>.</strong> More than <a href="https://curs.unc.edu/2019/11/26/calling-it-home-latino-rental-housing-affordability/">55% of Latino renters</a> pay over 30% of their income in rent. The Plan’s investments help lower housing costs and increase the supply of affordable housing through tax credits and government financing, including constructing and rehabilitating more than one million sustainable rental housing units and more than 500,000 homes working families can afford. It will also make investments to preserve existing public housing as well as remove lead-based paint from housing units.<br><br><strong>CUT TAXES</strong><br><strong><em>Tax Cuts for Families with Children.</em></strong><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5743308460b5e922a25a6dc7/t/601acf15866c634924d12963/1612369686861/Poverty-Reduction-Analysis-Biden-Economic-Relief-CPSP-2021.pdf"> 21.2 percent of Hispanic people </a>fall below the poverty line, struggling to pay expenses like food, rent, health care and transportation for their families.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Since our founding, courageous men and women&nbsp;have vowed to serve and defend our country, protect our&nbsp;citizens, and uphold the principles of our Constitution.&nbsp; The&nbsp;citizen Soldiers and Airmen of the National Guard, and the&nbsp;Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen of&nbsp;the Reserve, proudly carry on this tradition today.&nbsp; During National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, we&nbsp;thank and celebrate the civilian employers whose support of&nbsp;our&nbsp;National Guard and Reserve members helps to sustain our&nbsp;all‑volunteer force and our national spirit of service.</p>



<p>National Guard and Reserve members are essential to the safety and security of our Nation, ready to serve at home or abroad at any moment&#8217;s notice.&nbsp; From working on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, to responding to storm damage and raging wildfires, to&nbsp;deploying overseas, supporting peacekeeping missions abroad, and conducting multilateral exercises with allies and partner nations, National Guard and Reserve members put their lives on hold &#8212; away from both their families and their civilian workplaces &#8212; to stand as a shield or a support whenever our country is in need.&nbsp; When they complete their mission, National Guard and Reserve members return to their civilian careers and fulfill their obligation of monthly weekend drills and annual trainings &#8212; always ensuring they are ready to answer the next call to serve.</p>



<p>We owe a profound gratitude to our National Guard and Reserve members, as well as their civilian employers.&nbsp; In&nbsp;supporting their talented employees&#8217; service to our Nation, employers of National Guard and Reserve members directly contribute to our military readiness and our national security.&nbsp; As our Guard and Reserve members navigate the challenges that accompany their service, many civilian employers go&nbsp;above and beyond to support our service members and their families. &nbsp;National Guard and Reserve members should not have to&nbsp;worry about their civilian employment while they are serving on a mission, and many employers are stepping up with generous pay and leave policies, extension of benefits like health care for family members, and flexibility and support for Guard and Reserve spouses to help fulfill our sacred obligation as a&nbsp;Nation to always take care of those who serve in uniform.</p>



<p>My Administration understands the national security imperative behind improving the well-being of our service members and their families as they balance the pressures of their civilian careers with the demands of military service. &nbsp;Through the First Lady&#8217;s work with Joining Forces, we are committed to supporting military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors through economic and entrepreneurship opportunities, support for military child education, and health and well-being resources. &nbsp;Ensuring continuing economic opportunities for military and veteran families through meaningful employment is essential, and we are&nbsp;grateful for all&nbsp;of the employers who understand the value in&nbsp;hiring and retaining National Guard and Reserve members and their spouses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Biden family is a National Guard family, and we are forever grateful and in awe of those who, like our son Beau, understand that duty and service to others is what makes us who&nbsp;we are as Americans. &nbsp;We understand some of the unique challenges that National Guard and Reserve members and their families face &#8212; challenges that are made smaller because of&nbsp;the&nbsp;incredible, patriotic support of their employers. &nbsp;I&nbsp;encourage all Americans to join me in recognizing and thanking employers of our National Guard and Reserve members for their vast contributions to our economy, our communities, and the success of our Nation and our Armed Forces.&nbsp; I also encourage National Guard and Reserve members to recognize their employers who have gone above and beyond in supporting them with the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR), the Department of Defense program that promotes cooperation and understanding between civilian employers and their National Guard and Reserve employees.</p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in&nbsp;me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do&nbsp;hereby proclaim August 15 through August 21, 2021, as National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week.&nbsp; I&nbsp;call&nbsp;upon the people of the United States, State and local officials, private organizations, and all military commanders to&nbsp;honor employers of National Guard and Reserve members with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of August, in the year of our Lord two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United&nbsp;States of&nbsp;America the two&nbsp;hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON – Today, President Biden announced that he has appointed the following individuals to the U.S. AbilityOne Commission, which administers the AbilityOne Program, one of the nation’s largest sources of employment for people who are blind or have significant disabilities:</p>



<ul><li>Bryan Bashin, Appointee for Commissioner</li><li>Christina Brandt, Appointee for Commissioner</li><li>Gabriel M. Cazares, Appointee for Commissioner</li><li>Chai Rachel Feldblum, Appointee for Commissioner</li></ul>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Bryan Bashin, Commissioner</strong><br>Bryan Bashin is CEO of the Lighthouse for the Blind and Visually-Impaired in San Francisco, a 119-year-old nonprofit devoted to the comprehensive training and employment of blind people.  For 30 years his organization has employed blind workers through the National Industries for the Blind, one of the central non-profits in the AbilityOne program. Over the last 11 years, Bashin has overseen significant expansions of direct blind employment in the AbilityOne space, but most importantly in competitive, integrated workplaces. Bashin previously worked as an Assistant Regional Commissioner for the Department of Education’s Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) where he supervised $400 million in federal disability spending in Arizona, Nevada, California, Hawaii, and Pacific territories. From 1998 until 2004, Bashin was Executive Director of the Sacramento Society for the Blind, where he led a strong expansion of blindness services, including competitive employment programs. Bashin has also been an expert witness in cases involving employment of people with disabilities. A former science journalist, Bashin is well acquainted with industrial and technical processes and skill needs of employers. Bashin is currently a Board member of VisionServe Alliance, a membership association of more than 100 U.S. blindness agencies. <br><br><strong>Christina Brandt, Commissioner</strong><br>Christina Brandt is the CEO of an innovative nonprofit, an AbilityOne producer with over four decades of quality service to the government customer.

<p>Today, the Biden Administration is taking action to improve the health of rural communities by making millions of dollars in American Rescue Plan funding available to meet immediate COVID-19 needs. This funding, which will also help rural hospitals stay open in the long run and improve the care provided to rural communities, builds on efforts the Administration has already taken to help rural communities tackle the COVID-19 crisis and improve access to health care. And these actions are only the beginning. President Biden’s Build Back Better agenda – also known as the reconciliation package – will make crucial investments in rural Americans’ health by lowering prescription drug and other health care costs, expanding access to care, and improving maternal health, and the bipartisan infrastructure legislation will improve the quality of drinking water in rural communities.</p>



<p><strong><u>NEW ACTIONS</u></strong></p>



<p><strong>Helping health care providers in rural areas cover costs associated with COVID-19 and keep their doors open.</strong> The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is providing $8.5 billion in American Rescue Plan funding in the coming weeks to help compensate health care providers who serve rural Medicare, Medicaid, and Children’s Health Insurance Plan (CHIP) patients for lost revenue and increased expenses associated with COVID-19<strong>. </strong>These funds will help ensure that providers can effectively respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and will place them on stable financial footing to continue serving their communities into the future.</p>



<p><strong>Expanding rural hospitals and providers’ access to COVID-19 vaccines, testing, and supplies, while helping rural health care providers stay financially solvent in the long-term.</strong> The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is using $500 million in American Rescue Plan funding to create the Emergency Rural Health Care Grant Program. The program will provide at least $350 million to help rural hospitals and local communities increase access to COVID-19 vaccines and testing, medical supplies, telehealth, and food assistance, and support construction or renovation of rural health care facilities. Applicants can also apply for recovery funds that compensate for lost revenue or staffing expenses due to COVID-19. In addition, the program will provide up to $125 million in grants to plan and implement models that help improve the long-term viability of rural health care providers, including health care networks that allow rural providers to collectively address community challenges and develop innovative solutions.</p>



<p><strong>Training new rural health care providers, including community health workers and respiratory therapists, and expanding telehealth. </strong>HHS will make $52 million from the American Rescue Plan available to train a range of health care workers to fill in-demand professions affected by the pandemic. Specifically, HHS is creating rural health networks by pairing together minority-serving institutions, community colleges, technical colleges, rural hospitals, Rural Health Clinics, community health centers, nursing homes and substance abuse providers. Networks will focus on cross-training and sustaining community health workers in rural communities; expanding the workforce to support electronic health records as well as virtual and telehealth systems; expanding the capacity of emergency medical services reduced by pandemic-driven service reductions by developing Community Paramedicine programs; and training case management staff and respiratory therapists, who will play a critical role in helping rural clinical sites better serve patients affected by long-term COVID health challenges.The application will be available in the coming weeks.</p>



<p><strong>Expanding access to pulmonary rehabilitation services.</strong> HHS is announcing that, in FY 2022, it will support a demonstration project to enhance access to pulmonary rehabilitation services in Critical Access Hospitals that serve rural communities with high rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is one of the leading causes of death in the U.S., and adults in rural areas are almost twice as likely to have it compared to those in urban areas.</p>



<p><strong>Expanding Veterans Affairs training programs for rural providers. </strong>The Rural Interprofessional Faculty Development Initiative (RIFDI), developed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), is an innovative two-year training program designed to provide teaching and training skills for clinicians in rural settings, preparing rural clinicians to take on faculty roles, mentor medical professionals to serve in rural America, and grow the healthcare workforce in rural communities. By the end of this calendar year, VA will launch a new joint initiative with HHS, adding non-VA community clinicians to the program. This joint initiative will benefit up to 40 rural communities each year and enable rural clinicians to better train the next generation of clinicians who will serve rural America.</p>



<p><strong>Increasing access to telehealth.</strong> The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is announcing that it will hold a virtual <a href="https://prevention.nih.gov/research-priorities/research-needs-and-gaps/pathways-prevention/improving-rural-health-through-telehealth-guided-provider-provider-communication">public workshop</a> to identify ways to improve rural health through telehealth-guided provider-to-provider communication as part of its ongoing Pathways to Prevention series October 12-14th. With the rapid expansion of telehealth during the pandemic, this workshop will bring together key NIH partners, other federal agencies, researchers and community stakeholders to assess the existing evidence, identify gaps and develop plans to move telehealth forward. In addition, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently proposed a new rule to expand access to telehealth mental health services for rural and vulnerable populations by allowing Medicare to pay for mental health visits furnished via telehealth when they are provided by Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). This proposal would expand access to Medicare beneficiaries, especially those living in rural and other underserved areas.</p>



<p><strong><u>BUILDING RURAL HEALTH BACK BETTER</u></strong></p>



<p>The President’s Build Back Better agenda – also referred to as the reconciliation package –would continue to build on these successes and deliver lower cost, higher quality health care to rural Americans.</p>



<p><strong>Lower Health Care Costs. </strong>More than <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/04/health-insurance-rural-america.html">12% of people living in completely rural counties</a> lacked health insurance before President Biden took office; coverage under the Affordable Care Act (even with its premium subsidies) was too expensive for many families; and <a href="/aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/pdf/265621/aspe-data-point-medicaid-expansion-new-eligible.pdf%3c">nearly 2.3 million people</a> were not afforded coverage because their state refused to expand Medicaid. The Build Back Better agenda:</p>



<ul><li>Extends the higher premium subsidies that were a part of the American Rescue plan to keep health insurance affordable for millions of Americans, including those living in rural communities.</li><li>Adds comprehensive dental, vision, and hearing coverage for Medicare beneficiaries, expanding coverage for millions of rural Americans.</li><li>Expands Medicaid coverage in all states to cover to more rural Americans. In 2019, the rural uninsured rate was <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/access-care-rural-america">nearly twice as high</a> in non-expansion states as expansion states.</li><li>Invests $3 billion in improving maternal health and tackling health disparities.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Lower Prescription Drug Costs. </strong>Americans pay 2-3 times more for their prescription drugs than people in other wealthy countries, and nearly 1 in 4 Americans struggle to afford prescription drugs. President Biden’s plan would lower prescription drug costs for Americans by letting Medicare negotiate drug prices, so consumers, including those in rural communities, are no longer at the whim of pharmaceutical companies.</p>



<p><strong>Keep More Rural Hospitals Open. </strong>The President’s Build Back Better proposal would help keep rural hospitals open by expanding Medicaid. Three quarters of rural hospitals that are vulnerable to closure are in states that have yet to expand Medicaid, and Medicaid expansion reduces the risk of rural hospital closure by 62%.</p>



<p><strong>Improve the Safety of Rural Drinking Water. </strong>The bipartisan infrastructure legislation that recently passed the Senate deals with aging water systems that threaten public health in thousands of communities nationwide. An estimated six to ten million homes still receive drinking water through lead pipes and service lines. The legislation would upgrade and modernize America’s drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater systems, tackle new contaminants, and support clean water infrastructure across rural America with $56 billion in grants and low-cost flexible loans to states, Tribes, territories, and disadvantaged communities across the country.</p>



<p><strong><u>PREVIOUS BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS TO SUPPORT RURAL AMERICANS’ HEALTH</u></strong></p>



<p><strong>Helped Rural Communities Fight COVID-19. </strong>Rural communities have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 and the Administration has taken targeted steps to bolster the COVID-19 response in those areas.<strong> </strong>For example, the Administration has allocated over $4 billion to address COVID-19 challenges in rural communities. This funding—which includes funds from the American Rescue Plan—supports increased testing and mitigation efforts in small rural hospitals, Medicare-certified Rural Health Clinics, and efforts to build vaccine confidence through targeted educational immunization campaigns and vaccine outreach to rural communities. <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Expanded Access to Quality Health Care in Rural Communities. </strong>The President’s agenda to improve health in rural America aims to expand access to health coverage, so that families can get the care they need at an affordable price.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Lowered health insurance costs for rural Americans.</strong> In February, the Administration opened a Special Enrollment Period to provide all Americans the opportunity to obtain quality, affordable health care. More than 300,000 rural Americans have enrolled in coverage as a result of the Special Enrollment Period. And, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, millions of Americans, including Americans in rural communities, have found lower health insurance premiums on plans purchased through HealthCare.gov. Uninsured rural Americans can still find a zero- or low-premium plan – but the last day to sign up at HealthCare.gov is August 15.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Through the <a href="https://innovation.cms.gov/innovation-models/chart-model">Community Health Access and Rural Transformation (CHART) Model</a>, HHS is providing new ways for rural communities to transform their health care delivery systems. Participating rural providers can take advantage of regulatory flexibilities to structure payments in a way that rewards the quality of care and health outcomes instead of the volume of services provided.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Initiated Actions to Keep More Rural Hospitals Open.</strong> <a href="https://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/programs-projects/rural-health/rural-hospital-closures/">138 rural hospitals have shuttered</a> since 2010, with 19 hospitals closing in 2020 alone.&nbsp;For many rural communities, keeping rural hospitals open means the difference between life or death for community members. It also means jobs and economic opportunity. In addition to the American Rescue Plan funds announced today, the Administration has already taken several steps to help keep rural providers open.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Took initial action to establish a new provider type, Rural Emergency Hospitals, to fill a gap in rural care.</strong> In response to the growing concern that closures of rural hospitals and Critical Access Hospitals are leading to a lack of services for people living in rural areas and the loss of access to emergency care, HHS has taken the initial step to determine how to <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-proposes-rule-increase-price-transparency-access-care-safety-health-equity">design a new provider type</a>, Rural Emergency Hospitals (REHs). In the future, REHs will be required to furnish emergency department services and observation care and may provide other outpatient medical and health services.</li><li><strong>Promoted hospital competition and price transparency.</strong> Hospital consolidation has left many areas, <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-93">especially in rural communities</a>, without good options for convenient and affordable health care service. In his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">executive order promoting competition</a>, the President underscored that hospital mergers that reduce health care access can be harmful to patients and encouraged the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to review and revise their merger guidelines to ensure patients are not harmed by such mergers. He also directed HHS to support existing hospital price transparency rules and to finish implementing bipartisan federal legislation to address surprise hospital billing.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Expanded the Pipeline of Rural Health Care Workers.</strong> Increasing the number of rural individuals going to medical school or other health care training programs and returning to rural communities to provide care is critical to bolstering access to health care in rural communities.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Proposed a budget that</strong><strong> strengthens the rural health care provider pipeline. </strong>The President’s FY22 budget request includes a number of investments to build the pipeline of rural health care providers, including:<ul><li>$13 million to expand the Rural Residency Planning and Development Program to develop new residency programs in rural communities to train physicians in rural practice settings, an increase of $2 million above FY2021 enacted levels.</li></ul><ul><li>Continued support for loan repayment and scholarships for clinicians practicing in high-need rural and underserved areas through roughly $477 million in total program funding for the National Health Service Corps.</li></ul><ul><li>$20 million above FY 2021 enacted budget to continue a nationwide expansion of the Community Health Aide Program to the lower 48 states to enhance care for tribal populations. This evidence-based program, which has measurably improved access to health care in rural Alaska, has the potential to expand access to high quality care in remote and rural areas in Indian Country.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p><strong>Provided Funding to Treat Substance Use Disorders and Address the Opioid Epidemic in Rural Communities<a>. </a></strong>The opioid epidemic has shattered families and ravaged communities. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to tackling this epidemic and ensuring support for the full continuum of prevention, harm reduction, treatment and recovery support services. The Administration has: <strong></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Improved prevention and treatment of substance use disorder. </strong>HHS announced $85.5 million in funding to rural communities to address the opioid epidemic and substance use issues in rural America. This includes 78 implementation grants to focus on prevention and treatment and 15 awards that will focus on communities addressing misuse of psycho-stimulants, such as methamphetamine.</li><li><strong>Lifted a moratorium on opioid treatment programs with a mobile component.</strong> The Drug Enforcement Administration recently lifted a decade-long moratorium on opioid treatment programs that want to include a mobile component. This <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/briefing-room/2021/06/29/biden-harris-administration-expands-treatment-to-underserved-communities-with-mobile-methadone-van-rule-2021/">rule change</a> will help remove a critical barrier to treatment for rural and other underserved communities, including incarcerated individuals.</li><li><strong>Put forward a budget to address the opioid epidemic.</strong> The President’s FY22 budget request includes $165 million to address the opioid epidemic in hard-hit rural communities, an increase of $55 million.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Prioritized Maternal Health in Rural America. </strong>Maternal mortality is rising in the U.S. Rural women experience poorer maternal health outcomes compared to their non-rural counterparts, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/advisory-committees/rural/publications/2020-maternal-obstetric-care-challenges.pdf">higher pregnancy-related mortality</a>. Women in rural communities also experience racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in maternal health outcomes. These disparities are amplified for women living in tribal communities. The Administration has:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Funded improvements in rural maternal care</strong><strong>.</strong> HHS awarded an additional $3 million in funds for the Rural Maternity and Obstetrics Management Strategies (RMOMS) program. This program, which the Administration proposes to expand in its FY22 budget proposal, develops models and implements strategies that improve access to and continuity of maternal obstetrics care in rural communities. Applicants are required to focus on populations that have historically suffered from poorer health outcomes, health disparities, and other inequities.</li><li><strong>Put forward a budget to keep improving maternal health. </strong>The President’s discretionary budget request includes more than $200 million to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates nationwide, bolster Maternal Mortality Review Committees, and expand the RMOMS program, among other actions. <strong></strong></li></ul>



<p><strong>Prioritized Access to Clean Drinking Water. </strong>Across the country, water pipes and treatment plants are aging and polluted drinking water is endangering public health.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Put forward a budget prioritizing clean drinking water in low-income communities.</strong> The President’s FY22 budget proposal requests $22 million for the Rural Community Development Program, which provides grants to assist low-income communities in developing affordable and safe water and wastewater treatment facilities.</li></ul>
