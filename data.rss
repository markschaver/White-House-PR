<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>3:33 P.M. EST</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Happy Wednesday.&nbsp; Are we Wednesday?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; We have a graphic here today because it&#8217;s been awhile since we&#8217;ve had a graphic, so I wanted to deliver on that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, as you all know, we announced our first tranche of sanctions in less &#8212; less than a day after the beginning of the invasion, with Allies and partners from the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Australia.</p>



<p>And what I &#8212; we wanted to provide to all of you today is an overview of what we&#8217;re seeing as an impact on the Russian economy.&nbsp; Obviously, the bite of these sanctions has not taken place yet, so this is largely in anticipation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, let me just go through a couple of these points:</p>



<p>Borrowing costs for the Russian government has spiked to almost 11 percent &#8212; highest since 2015.</p>



<p>Foreign investors are fleeing Russia.</p>



<p>The Ruble is trading at its weakest level since November 2020 &#8212; one of the weakest currencies in the world.</p>



<p>In response to inflation risk, the Russian Central Bank has hiked rates eight times in the past year to 9.5 percent.</p>



<p>And Bloomberg reported &#8212; just going to cite Bloomberg there &#8212; that “The fortunes of Russia’s super-rich have tumbled $32 billion this year, with the escalating conflict in Ukraine poised to make that wealth destruction much larger.”</p>



<p>So, as I started off saying, this is before the bite even takes place.  And this is just after the beginning.  I mean, we&#8217;ve only had, obviously, a first tranche here.  But it&#8217;s &#8212; this is a vicious feedback loop that will get more severe if Putin doesn’t <s>escalate</s> [deescalate]. </p>



<p>So, as he&#8217;s looking at the impact on his own economy, on his rich and wealthy oligarch friends, and on the people of Russia, these are the facts, regardless of what you&#8217;re hearing from the Kremlin, about the impact.</p>



<p>Also, I just wanted to note, because I know that we put out these sanctions when a lot was happening yesterday &#8212; just wanted to give you a little bit more detail of them.&nbsp; Obviously, you, hopefully, have seen the announcement and the statement from the President about Nord Stream 2.&nbsp; We can come back to that, but that is an additional step today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And also, on banks and the announcement we made yesterday, what we did was we used our most powerful sanctions tool to target two major state-owned Russian banks for the first time; that is the significance.&nbsp; These banks can no longer &#8212; what it means is they can no longer make any transactions with the United States or Europe, and their assets in the financial system will be frozen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They are the glorified piggybanks &#8212; some of the glorified piggybanks for the Kremlin, including one of them which is a key financial institution where &#8212; where support &#8212; military finances has been held.&nbsp; And this will have a significant impact on Russian leadership and the inner circle because they&#8217;re state-owned control &#8212; banks controlled by them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also were clear yesterday &#8212; but again, there was a lot going on, so I just wanted to touch on this &#8212; on this lightly &#8212; that no financial institution is safe.&nbsp; And the authority that was announced yesterday means that we can expand this to other financial institutions in Russia.&nbsp; And we have every capability and capacity to do that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, we made an announcement about sovereign debt.&nbsp; And essentially, this means &#8212; I know there&#8217;s been a lot of &#8212; some commentary out there &#8212; some from Russia, of course &#8212; that they have a rainy-day fund.&nbsp; A rainy-day fund is limited.&nbsp; A rainy-day funds mean you can only tap into it until the rainy-day fund is done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ability to purchase sovereign debt means that you can gain access to additional funding.&nbsp; And what we are essentially doing is cutting off their ability to &#8212; to tap into that from the United States and Europe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, on elites, what is significant about this &#8212; and somebody asked me this question about what&#8217;s different.&nbsp; So, some of the people who were sanctioned yesterday are repeat people that we have sanctioned in the past.&nbsp; But the additional step we took was that we sanctioned family members, because what we&#8217;ve seen in terms of tactics that they&#8217;ve used in the past, is they have moved &#8212; they&#8217;re very sophisticated, some of these oligarchs; no surprise &#8212; they&#8217;ve moved money around to children, to family members so they could still have access to it.&nbsp; And we wanted to reduce the likelihood of that.&nbsp; So that is an additional step we took.&nbsp; So I just wanted to cover that.</p>



<p>One other note: Today also marks 100 days since the President signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.&nbsp; Time flies.&nbsp; It&#8217;s also day 400 of the administration.&nbsp; In the past 100 days, we&#8217;ve hit the ground running, rolling out nearly $100 billion worth of programs and funding to state and local governments.</p>



<p>This funding will help rebuild crumbling road and bridges, replace lead pipes, help provide high-speed Internet to every family in America, and produce concrete results that change people’s lives for the better.</p>



<p>To continue this momentum, today, the Department of Transportation announced nearly $450 million available to strengthen port infrastructure and supply chain resiliency.&nbsp; And, obviously, there is more to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chris, your first day in the AP seat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Welcome to the front of the room.&nbsp; No pressure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; So a few questions about Ukraine.&nbsp; First, you talked about the impact of the economy on Russia.&nbsp; Ukraine is also feeling a lot of economic pain right now.&nbsp; What more is the White House prepared to do to shore up their economy, provide them with financial assistance?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we have provided them an extensive amount of financial assistance, including recently announcing $1 billion in sovereign &#8212; I mean in loan guarantees.&nbsp; And that is something we are open to building upon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we are going to continue to assess what the impact is on the Ukrainian economy, what is needed on the ground.&nbsp; That applies to both access to &#8212; to, you know, economic assistance, as well as humanitarian assistance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I don&#8217;t have anything to announce today, but we will continue to be a large provider and supporter of financial and economic assistance to Ukraine.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new AP poll found that only 26 percent of Americans want the U.S. to play a major role in this &#8212; in this crisis.&nbsp; Given that this could increase costs on Americans &#8212; gas prices, other economic ripples &#8212; has the White House done enough to prepare Americans for what the U.S. role could be and what impact it could be on their lives?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, this is very important to the President personally.&nbsp; It&#8217;s why he gave remarks &#8212; delivered the remarks he did last week and why he has spoken several times to provide updates to the American people over the last couple of days.</p>



<p>Two pieces I would note that I think are very important as Americans are tuning in and learning more about this conf- &#8212; this potential conflict &#8212; this conflict that&#8217;s underway, I guess I should say, between Russia and Ukraine:</p>



<p>One, the President has no intention of sending U.S. military or U.S. troops to fight in Ukraine.&nbsp; It is hard to know &#8212; because I don&#8217;t think it was in your poll &#8212; how people assess what &#8220;major involvement&#8221; means.&nbsp; But that has not changed in terms of the President&#8217;s view and his approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second is he is going to do everything he can to reduce the impact on energy costs for the American people.&nbsp; And that means engaging closely with partners around the world.&nbsp; It means considering a range of options that are all on the table to reduce the market &#8212; the impact on the oil markets, and that is what would impact energy costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the last thing I would say is that the President and the White House &#8212; you know, we make national security decisions based on what&#8217;s best for our country&#8217;s national security, not on the latest polling.&nbsp; And if you step back, what, hopefully, the American people will see and have seen is that while Russia has sought to divide our allies and the American people, the President has sought to revitalize our partnerships and alliances and unite our country.&nbsp; He&#8217;s standing up for our national security interests and bedrock democratic values against the aggression of a dictator threatening to further invade a sovereign country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why he&#8217;s doing what he&#8217;s doing.&nbsp; So, we&#8217;re less focused on the politics of Ukraine and more focused on preventing a war.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other question &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; I have was: Yesterday, the administration said the goal of the sanctions is to “prevent and deter” a wider invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp; If Russia does attack, as U.S. officials are warning that they&#8217;re imminently prepared to do, does that mean that strategy has failed?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say as we look at it, we&#8217;re focused on accomplishing two things.&nbsp; One is implementing serious costs for the actions that have already been taken &#8212; so, the actions in the Donbas.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve taken steps beyond what we did in 2014, which, obviously, I just outlined at the beginning of the briefing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, yes, deterrence is part of our objective.&nbsp; If he goes further, we will go further.&nbsp; We have a range of tools at our disposal.&nbsp; I mentioned some of the potential financial step &#8212; or steps we could take that could impact financial institutions. &nbsp;That is &#8212; is very significant and could have a very significant impact, but we have far more options beyond that, including export controls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what export control steps would mean &#8212; you know, Russia &#8212; as President Putin looks to the future of Russia, there is a lot of access to different industries, technologies that he needs and would rely on in order for the economy to grow and flourish in the future, whether it&#8217;s AI, whether it&#8217;s other technological sectors, biotech, semiconductors &#8212; a term we&#8217;ve used a lot in here.&nbsp; And what this would do, would essentially cut off access to that; that would also be a significant step.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, point is: We have more steps we can take, and we&#8217;re going to continue to apply those if he escalates.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Given the possibility of an attack seems particularly high today, can you walk us through how the President is spending his day, how his security team is spending the day, if they&#8217;re doing anything in these &#8212; what could be these final hours before an attack, if that&#8217;s the case?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I &#8212; I&#8217;ve seen the reporting on this.&nbsp; But let me &#8212; let me be very clear: We have been saying for days that Russian military forces are in an attack position; that has not changed.&nbsp; They are capable of operationalizing at any point in time.&nbsp; We are in constant contact with the Ukrainians about their positioning, about their capacity and capabilities.&nbsp; We&#8217;re not predicting a day, a moment, or an hour.&nbsp; That has been our assessment and the &#8212; what we&#8217;ve been communicating with the Ukrainians for some time now.</p>



<p>Let me tell you, though, something else that we&#8217;re also seeing or assessing right now: We believe &#8212; obviously, we&#8217;ve laid out a game plan that we believe that President Putin has been implementing over the course of the last several weeks, if not longer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s clear &#8212; and what our assessment is, is that President Putin did not expect the United States to have the level of information that we have, did not expect us to put out this amount of information that we have put out, did not expect the global community to be as unified, including in the &#8212; how unified the global community was in putting out the sanctions yesterday.&nbsp; And what we&#8217;re seeing now &#8212; our assessment is that he is improvising, adapting, and we’re having to respond and adapt his own actions to &#8212; as we are even &#8212; as we are responding to him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we don&#8217;t have a new assessment.&nbsp; I will tell you that what the President is doing is what he has been doing for several days now, which is continuing to meet and engage with his national security team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, he had a PDB this morning, and he will receive regular updates from his team.&nbsp; He will continue to engaze [sic] clo- &#8212; engage closely with partners and Allies, some things that he &#8212; something that he has been doing for several days now.&nbsp; But that is cont- &#8212; the continuation of what our engagement has been.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, given that we could be looking at an imminent attack, is there anything this White House, this President believes he can do to stop it?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think &#8212; what I &#8212; I think what&#8217;s important to note here is we have been saying &#8220;imminent&#8221; for days now.&nbsp; And what I&#8217;m conveying to you is that we&#8217;re also seeing adjustments by President Putin or the need to adapt in response to what our actions and what our response has been.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what the President has been doing has cont- &#8212; has been continuing to work with partners and Allies to ensure we remain united, to leave the door open to diplomacy, but to make very clear to President Putin and to our partners around the world that there will be significant consequences beyond what we have done already should he invade further.</p>



<p>Go ahead, Jeff.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, what&#8217;s the next trigger point for new sanctions?&nbsp; Obviously, yesterday&#8217;s was the start of the invasion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does Putin have to do next to see another wave?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to give you a detailed, &#8220;If he does this, we will do that.&#8221;&nbsp; I would only just reiterate what I said a little bit earlier, which is that we have the specific authority, based on the announcement made yesterday, to take additional steps as it relates to financial institutions in Russia.&nbsp; There&#8217;s additional enormous financial institutions &#8212; the two largest banks, for example &#8212; which were not a part of the announcement made &#8212; we made yesterday.&nbsp; There&#8217;s additional steps we&#8217;ve expressed an openness to, including taking steps as it relates to export controls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, this &#8212; these are assessments we will continue to make internally.&nbsp; And we have a range of tools that we are prepared to &#8212; steps we are prepared to take should he further escalate.</p>



<p>Q    On Monday, when President Putin made clear that he was sending troops into those two breakaway regions, the White House initially said that does not constitute an invasion because Russia already has troops there; this is just &#8220;more overt.&#8221;  The next day, President Biden came out and said, “This is the start of invasion.”  What happened overnight?  What changed to lead to that change in rhetoric?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I talked about this a little bit yesterday, but what we looked at and what we assessed were a range of steps.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not, obviously, going to get into military assessments or movements today, just like I didn&#8217;t yesterday.&nbsp; But we looked at a couple of steps, including President Putin taking steps, as it relates to the Duma, to ask for authority to take additional military action beyond that region.&nbsp; We looked at his recognition.&nbsp; We looked at the position &#8212; positioning of troops and military.&nbsp; And we looked at the range of steps over that period of time to assess and make that decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would also note that our Deputy National Security Advisor was on TV conveying that that morning as well.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; And just lastly on this: The President of Russia, President Putin, said on Monday that he felt the West was going to impose sanctions basically regardless of what they did.&nbsp; Given that, you&#8217;re obviously trying and effectively putting a lot of pain on the Russian economy.&nbsp; Do you think these sanctions will actually be a deterrent?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think that is a decision for President Putin to make.&nbsp; I mean, there are statements he has conveyed, in terms of what he wants to achieve here, right?&nbsp; The division of NATO; the opposite is happening.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; He wanted to see Nord Stream 2 move forward &#8212; a key prize for him; that is obviously not happening.&nbsp; He wants to have a flourishing economy for the Russian people; just even without the bite of our sanctions, that is clearly not happening.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, this is an assessment he&#8217;s going to have to make, and we expect he’ll hear from people around him who are being impacted and other people in Russia about the impact of these sanctions.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the White House share the assessment of the Australian Prime Minister today that an attack is likely within 24 hours?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to give an additional timeline to it.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been saying it could happen at any time.&nbsp; And they are in attack position for some time now, but I&#8217;m not going to give you an additional day, hour, moment.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, just to follow up on that, you have been saying that it&#8217;s imminent for some time.&nbsp; You guys stopped for a little bit &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; and then you went back to it.&nbsp; Has there been a new warning to the Ukrainians in the last 24 hours or so?&nbsp; Because it seems that CNN and others are reporting that they have shared new intelligence about the threat of just how quickly an attack could happen.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We don&#8217;t know what that&#8217;s based on.&nbsp; We have been conveying &#8212; in close touch with the Ukrainians, we have been conveying that they are capable of operationalizing at any time.&nbsp; That has been the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;d also note that, obviously, our preference would be that President Putin doesn&#8217;t further invade.&nbsp; And as I said a few minutes ago, what we&#8217;re also assessing is that he has had to adjust, adapt to the strength of the unity of the global community, to what our reaction has been.&nbsp; And he has been forced to need to respond and adapt his own actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will see.&nbsp; We still very much anticipate and predict that he will invade further.&nbsp; But, again, we&#8217;re also seeing an impact on how he&#8217;s behaving.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on Nord Stream 2: Last month, the White House opposed an effort on Capitol Hill to put sanctions on this pipeline.&nbsp; Last year, of course, President Biden waived the sanctions on that.&nbsp; And now, today, he is imposing the sanctions on it, which is a pretty big shift.&nbsp; So, can you just explain the changes &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We don’t &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; and where you stand on that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we don&#8217;t see it as a shift at all.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve never supported the pipeline.&nbsp; It was 98 percent built when the President took office.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve always spoken out against the pipeline.&nbsp; The question was: What was the most effective step in order to have the result that we have now over the last 24 hours?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And there were calls by some in Congress to do preemptive sanctions on &#8212; or earlier sanctions &#8212; or take earlier steps, I should say, on Nord Stream 2.&nbsp; We disagreed with that strategy.&nbsp; We worked through a diplomatic path with the Germans.&nbsp; You saw the German Chancellor make the announcement yesterday, and the announcement today was complementary to that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the change is just because you were waiting on the Germans to take the first step here.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, actually, it was that we felt a diplomatic approach would be the most effective pro- &#8212; approach, and we have succeeded in our efforts.&nbsp; And we didn&#8217;t think the alternative approach was the right one.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My last question: A French official recently told the Wall Street Journal that during his last visit, the French President found Putin was &#8220;more rigid, isolated, and had basically gone into a sort of ideological and security-minded drift.&#8221;&nbsp; The President recently spent about an hour on the phone with him.&nbsp; Obviously, he knows Putin pretty well.&nbsp; I wonder if he has seen a change in the Russian leader.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any personal observations by President Biden about President Putin to read out.&nbsp; But I think we all watched, including the President, the speech &#8212; or read it &#8212; from the other night and saw a leader who was outlining a case for a war to his public &#8212; one that was based on revisionist history.&nbsp; And whether that&#8217;s based on isolation or not, we&#8217;ll leave that to others to assess.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; So you’ve said many times today that you &#8212; that there is not a new assessment.&nbsp; But yesterday, the President clearly chose his words carefully when he said the world was watching the start of an invasion, which is very different from the U.S. warning today that a full-scale Russian invasion is imminent.&nbsp; So, are you saying that nothing has changed between when we heard from the President yesterday and today?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m saying I don’t have &#8212; we have been saying for days that there has been &#8212; that they are prepared to launch a full-scale invasion.&nbsp; We saw the beginning of that yesterday.&nbsp; So, nothing has changed in that assessment.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about the figure of 80 percent of Russian troops are now in the forward attack position?&nbsp; Was that also the case yesterday?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to be in a position to give you move- &#8212; troop assessments or movements.&nbsp; But as I said just a few minutes ago, we &#8212; they are in an attack position.&nbsp; That remains the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then to follow up on something I asked Daleep yesterday, he said that the administration would not give a timeframe for when Americans might feel the impact of this conflict.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; I mean, the President has said we need to be honest about the cost of fighting for democracy.&nbsp; Can you share anything about a timeframe, a range?&nbsp; Should people be saving money?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think, Weijia, there&#8217;s been a little confusion about this because, one, the announ- &#8212; the sanctions that we announced yesterday will not have an impact on the American people.&nbsp; They will have an impact on the Russian elite, on financial institutions, on individuals who are trying to use those institutions to engage in &#8212; with Western banks, including President Putin and his inner circle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we&#8217;re seeing in the market is an anticipation of a further invasion by President Putin.&nbsp; And what we&#8217;re trying to do and focus on is take every step we can, working around the world with our counterparts and partners, to minimize the impact on the global energy market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re working on.&nbsp; We&#8217;re working on minimizing that, but there is not an impact from the sanctions we&#8217;ve announced on the American public.&nbsp; It really depends, in part, on what President Putin does in many regards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And finally, is one of those options looking at releasing more oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That is certainly an option on the table.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead, Peter.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Following up on Weijia’s question &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of focus on the economic pain in Russia, potentially, from these sanctions, but what about the economic pain here?&nbsp; The Russians are saying they think gas prices in Europe are going to double.&nbsp; How high could they get here?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think, again, Peter, as I said to Weijia, I mean, some of this depends on what President Putin does.&nbsp; So as he&#8217;s suggesting what the impact will be around the world, it&#8217;s all based on what his actions are, just to be very clear about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What the President is focused on and is working on is taking every step we can to communicate with, coordinate with, engage with big global suppliers around the world to minimize the impact on the energy markets.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even without all this going on, gas in California is almost $5 a gallon.&nbsp; Should people across the country expect to see that kind of a number when they go to gas up their car &#8212; $5, $6?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, I think as you heard the President say last week, standing up for our values is not without cost.&nbsp; What we&#8217;re trying to do is minimize that cost.&nbsp; So, I don&#8217;t have a prediction of it right now because we&#8217;re trying to minimize the impact on the global energy markets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Something that you said &#8212; two different things that you&#8217;ve said so far today: You said you think right now Putin is improvising and adapting.&nbsp; But you&#8217;ve also said that you very much anticipate and predict that he&#8217;s going to invade further.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, which is it: Is he adapting, or is he still invading?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Think big here, Peter.&nbsp; He can still be preparing to invade &#8212; which we&#8217;ve said, and that continues to be the case &#8212; while making adaptations on when, if, how to, what his strategy is.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re seeing. &nbsp;Both are true.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But &#8212; so if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re seeing &#8212; he announced sanctions yesterday &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did any Russian military units turn around and head back towards Russia?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, I&#8217;m not going to get into assessments from here of movements of any military.&nbsp; But also, what we&#8217;re trying to do is prevent a war, prevent devastation on the Ukrainian people.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re already seeing the impact on the economy in Russia.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to continue to make clear that there are much &#8212; that as &#8212; if he continues to escalate, we will as well.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as we wait to see if or how Russia might retaliate against the U.S., the FBI is reportedly warning businesses about cybersecurity risks.&nbsp; So why did you say there is no current threat as it relates to cyber here?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There is no current threat as it relates to cyber here.&nbsp; The FBI and all of the agencies in the government always provide regular updates on what businesses and entities should do to prepare for the potential for. &nbsp;There is still no immediate specific threat.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But on Friday, the Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber came in here to say, “We don&#8217;t have the level of cyber resilience that we wish.”&nbsp; Why would somebody come to the White House briefing room and talk about that if there is no threat?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Because we anticipate that there could be continuing threats in the future, and what we need private sector companies to do is harden their cybersecurity capabilities now.&nbsp; Now is the time to do it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then, finally, the State Department spokesman today said you guys are doing everything you reasonably can to prevent human rights abuses, atrocities, and potential war crimes in Ukraine.&nbsp; How can you say that if all that you&#8217;re announcing is financial punishment?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That isn&#8217;t all we&#8217;re announcing.&nbsp; We have provided a range of assistance to Ukraine &#8212; humanitarian assistance, security assistance &#8212; the most of any year in history.&nbsp; We will continue to build on all of this assistance.&nbsp; We are plussing-up support for our partners and Allies in the region to ensure they know we have our ba- &#8212; their backs and we are abiding by our NATO obligations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we continue to also provide &#8212; I think what he was referring to is a range of public information as well &#8212; to make clear what the intentions are of the Russians, to call them out for the type of actions we could see them taking in the future.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, if I can ask you about Nord Stream 2 to have a little better understanding of this right now.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you say &#8212; we&#8217;ve seen the sanctions.&nbsp; Can you say declaratively that this pipeline will never be operational, that this is effectively dead?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we &#8212; not only did the Chancellor of Germany announce it&#8217;s not moving forward, we also announced additional sanctions today.&nbsp; And it is not moving forward right now, no.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So would you say &#8212; but just for clarity, you say it&#8217;s not moving forward right now.&nbsp; But there have been some concern among some critics that though he did announce the suspension, that, at a later date, that Chancellor Scholz could say, “Yes, we are going to begin the process again.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, when you say “right now,” that means right now; that doesn&#8217;t mean for perpetuity?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It’s currently dead at the bottom of the sea, Peter.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to get ahead of where we are in the process.&nbsp; It is not happening.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not moving forward.&nbsp; It hasn&#8217;t been operational for some time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, that is where it stands.&nbsp; And this is all the result of diplomatic engagement and leadership by the President and his engagement with Chancellor Scholz.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me ask you about some other security issues as best you&#8217;re able to detail.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know there&#8217;s some things you can&#8217;t discuss.&nbsp; So, without detailing specifics that you can&#8217;t discuss, what role is the U.S. playing in securing President Zelenskyy’s safety?&nbsp; And does the U.S. bear some responsibility in making sure that he is safe?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:  I&#8217;m not going to detail our conversations or engagements about security with the President of Ukraine, who remains in Kyiv and is continuing to lead the country.<br><br>Q    Do we bear some responsibility, though, for making sure &#8212; without detailing what you&#8217;re doing, do we bear some responsibility for making sure that he is safe?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  We are going to continue to engage with him privately.  I&#8217;m not going to detail or speak to it further from here.<br><br>Q    If I could ask you just a last quick question.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Sure.<br><br>Q    Is there any circumstance &#8212; obviously, we&#8217;re focusing so much on Ukraine, as evidenced by these questions.  Is there any circumstance in which the President would hold his announcement of a Supreme Court pick after February?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  No. <br><br>Q    Declaratively, it&#8217;ll happen before then. <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Yes.<br><br>Q    Has he made a decision yet?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I don&#8217;t have any updates on that. <br><br>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it&#8217;s been asked a few different times, but just to clarify: You and other officials have said that the purpose of withholding additional and harsher sanctions is so that they have a deterrent effect.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at the same time, you&#8217;re saying that a broader invasion is likely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So how are both of those true, if the idea is that they would have a deterrent effect?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;re trying to prevent that from happening, and we are making very clear what &#8212; how impactful and serious what we&#8217;re considering, in terms of additional sanctions, could be.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And are &#8212; is inflation playing a role at all in deciding, you know, what gets sanctioned, what &#8212; how you&#8217;re thinking about the sanctions package?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Inflation in the United States, I assume you&#8217;re referring to?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Global inflation.<br><br>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Look, I think we look at a range of factors.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll use the energy markets as an example, because I know that was a question that was asked yesterday.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a good one.&nbsp;<br><br>You know, as we look at what sectors we&#8217;re going to sanction, one of the factors we look at is what can have the biggest impact, of course, on Russian leadership, people around President Putin, on the Russian economy.&nbsp; What we&#8217;re trying to minimize is what impact there&#8217;s going to be on the United States and global markets, in a lot of ways.&nbsp;<br><br>And if you look at energy &#8212; the energy sector as an example, sanctioning them further could also mean that President Putin and people around him get richer.<br><br>So we look at a range of factors and, certainly, the impact on the global economy is a factor as we consider options.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Russia does launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, should we expect to hear from the President, as we have in the last few days?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would expect you would, yes.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he would address the nation in some televised fashion?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would expect you would hear from the President, as you have.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, can you explain a little bit more for people who are trying to follow this continuing situation with Russia and Ukraine, why would the U.S. not directly sanction Putin at this time?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It remains an option on the table.&nbsp; What I would say to people who are trying to understand why is that sanctions are designed to &#8212; we&#8217;ve always designed them to increase, be escalatory.&nbsp; That would be an escalatory step, as would be sanctioning the largest banks &#8212; the very largest banks and additional components of the financial sector, as would taking export control steps be.&nbsp; So, there&#8217;s a range of escalatory steps we have as options.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You mentioned the sanctions on oligarchs at the top, and the President was a little unclear in his wording yesterday.&nbsp; He said that sanctions on Russian elites wouldn&#8217;t start until today; that was crossed out in the transcript to yesterday.&nbsp; The reason I&#8217;m asking is, as part of the, sort of, first tranche &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; of sanctions, are we going to see more elites sanctioned, or would that only happen if Russia takes additional escalatory steps?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I can check if there are additional ones.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not tracking additional ones that we&#8217;re holding for a rollout.&nbsp;<br><br>I will note, on your first part of your question, that for the elites &#8212; individuals, if they were to have used their fi- &#8212; their bank card, I guess, to make a financial transaction, it wouldn&#8217;t have been working yesterday.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a cyberattack on Ukrainian government websites today.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know the NSC has already said that it was sort of similar to the one that we saw on Ukrainian banks earlier and would be in keeping with what you expect from Russia.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m wondering if, at this point, you&#8217;ve made a definitive determination if Russia was responsible, and, if so, if you have any sort of retaliation &#8212; or response to that announcement.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, we have not &#8212; we have not attributed today&#8217;s activity yet.&nbsp; That would be very fast &#8212; even fast for us, as fast as last week was.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We do consider it, as I think some of my NSC colleagues said, to be consistent with the type of activity Russia would carry out in a bid to destabilize Ukraine.&nbsp; It&#8217;s consistent with what we saw last week, where we attributed similar incidents to the Russian government.&nbsp; And we, of course, consider these further incidents to be consistent with a type of activity we&#8217;ve seen Russia take over the course of time.<br><br>We are in conversation with Ukraine regarding the cyber-related needs, including as recently as today.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to move with urgency to assess the nature and extent of this, what steps needs to be taken, and, therefore, our response.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then the President has got a meeting &#8212; a virtual meeting with the G7 tomorrow morning.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, I think the topic is going to be Ukraine &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; but I was wondering if you could put any meat on the bone, in terms of what the President is trying to &#8212; what his objective is in that &#8212; in that meeting on what he’s looking to accomplish.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, one of the steps the President has been focused on is ensuring that we are coordinated with key allies and partners around the world, and certainly the G7 is an important entity to remain very closely engaged with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The G7 is 50 percent of the world&#8217;s economy and joined us &#8212; all of them &#8212; in this first tranche of sanctions announced yesterday.&nbsp;<br><br>The President isn&#8217;t a believer that this level of coordination happens by accident; it happens through a lot of work and in close engagement.&nbsp; We&#8217;re obviously at a pivotal point in this &#8212; in this process, and so he felt tomorrow was a time to discuss with them what we&#8217;re seeing, what it looks like, what&#8217;s next, and engage in this format.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, a couple of questions.&nbsp; On this first tranche of sanctions, have what&#8217;s going to be announced in that first batch been announced, or will we see more things today?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The first tranche has been announced.&nbsp; And, obviously, the Nord Stream 2 announcement today is an additional part of that.&nbsp; I can certainly check if there&#8217;s anything additional coming at this point beyond for the first tranche &#8212; not that I am aware of, but I will check and make sure that&#8217;s correct.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, when you all talk about this first tranche of sanctions, can you give us a sense of, like, how many tranches &#8212; if that’s the right word &#8212; are in this toolbox that you have to apply?&nbsp; You know, how many sets of sanctions are we talking about?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I understand the question.&nbsp; It&#8217;s hard for me to give that assessment.&nbsp; It really depends on what escalatory actions President Putin takes.&nbsp; If he goes further, we will go further.&nbsp; What that looks like, I can&#8217;t outline for you at this point in time.<br><br>I gave you the sense, a little bit, of what some additional options are &#8212; right? &#8212; export controls; sanctioning additional financial institutions, larger financial institutions.&nbsp; Those are all on the table, as are other options.<br><br>But in terms of what the breakdown of tranches would look like, I can’t outline that from &#8212; for you at this point from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in terms of the cyberattack, which you just were asked about, does &#8212; will the U.S. or could we expect the U.S. to have some sort of retaliatory behavior towards Russia in response to this?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We always reserve that option and, obviously, we haven&#8217;t made an attribution for this recent DDoS attack.&nbsp; As we go through the process of doing that, we&#8217;ll certainly consider what actions could be taken as well.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask one final question, actually, on the JCPOA?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been reports that the U.S., Iran is reaching, closing in on some sort of deal.&nbsp; Would you all confirm that that is an accurate assessment &#8212; that you are inching towards a potential deal this week?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, what we&#8217;re seeing is there is significant progress being made, and we are close to a possible deal.&nbsp; But there are a number of very difficult issues that remain unresolved.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s very little time remaining to reach a deal given the pace of Iran&#8217;s nuclear advances.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, I would note that typically the most difficult components &#8212; the last mile &#8212; is where it &#8212; where there is the most difficult conversations and negotiations.&nbsp;<br><br>So, yes, significant progress and we are close.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s a lot that still needs to be worked out.&nbsp;<br><br>It is true that Iran &#8212; we believe if Iran shows seriousness, we can and should reach an understanding on mutual return to full implementation of the JCPOA within &#8212; potentially within days.&nbsp; But there is still more work that needs to be done.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you all are optimistic or &#8212; I mean, that’s a mixed (inaudible)?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We are &#8212; we are encouraged by the significant progress, but, having been through a few of these, I would note that, often, the most difficult negotiations happen in the &#8212; in the last portion.<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead, Zolan.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; So, following up on the Nord Stream, just &#8212; I&#8217;m wondering if anything happened. I understand you were saying that there was an intent to want to do this in a coordinated way with the Germans and, obviously, they made their action yesterday.&nbsp; But was there anything else that happened on the ground in Ukraine yesterday that warranted the sanction happening today rather than yesterday?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No, it &#8212; but it&#8217;s part of our first tranche of sanctions, so we would see it as a part of what was rolled out yesterday.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, you were also telling &#8212; I think you told Kaitlan that you wanted this approach with Germany rather than an alternative.&nbsp; Just looking at, you know, the President last year said, in Cincinnati, that construction is already kind of going at this point.&nbsp; I believe the exact quote &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, 90 percent of it.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; He was saying 90 percent.&nbsp; So why is this a better way, a more effective way than issuing sanctions unilaterally and then possibly pressuring the Germans to take action themselves?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, it hasn&#8217;t been operational, which is an important component, right?&nbsp; It&#8217;s not like oil has been flowing through Nord Stream 2, which is a very important component here.&nbsp; And we made the assessment &#8212; others can have different assessments &#8212; that this would be the way to achieve the outcome that we&#8217;ve now achieved.&nbsp; Others can have different assessments.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no proof or evidence that their approach would have worked.&nbsp; Ours has worked.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More so the question was: Why would not issuing sanctions last year, earlier &#8212; why wouldn&#8217;t have that been effective?&nbsp; Why is this approach &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Because we felt working in coordination with our German counterparts through a diplomatic process would be the most effective way to approach it.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then a pivot &#8212; just two more.&nbsp; Can you outline what exactly Doug Jones has been doing in terms of the SCOTUS process, who he&#8217;s been talking to on the Hill?<br><br>Lastly, the March 18th mask mandate for travel, just &#8212; is the administration considering extending that or is that seen as an expiration date?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; On the first, I&#8217;m sure once there is an announcement to be made, we will have more detail about all of the engagements that have led up to it.&nbsp; But certainly, Senator Jones is playing an integral role engaging with senators, engaging with different stakeholders and individuals who want to &#8212; to give their view on where this should head.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have more details once an announcement is made.<br><br>As it relates to the March 18th timeline, the CDC is in the process of reviewing their mask guidelines and their mask guidance.&nbsp; We will let them make any announcements on that.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have anything to predict at this point about March 18th and the &#8212; and where that stands on planes.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Earlier during today&#8217;s briefing, you said it&#8217;s the U.S.’s assessment that President Putin did not expect the U.S. to have this level of information that we have, did not expect us to put out the amount of information that we put out, and did not expect the global community to be as unified as it is.&nbsp; What have you seen from Putin&#8217;s actions, from Russia&#8217;s actions that have led to that conclusion, that assessment?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think why I was conveying that is because what we&#8217;ve seen &#8212; and I don&#8217;t think I can give much more detail than that, other than to say what we&#8217;ve seen is him adjusting and adapting some of his actions and needing to respond to what our actions are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we&#8217;ve obviously been making a &#8212; assessing that he is prepared to operationalize at any time.&nbsp; That has not changed.&nbsp; But, you know, we are also watching closely what he does.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what&#8217;s your response &#8212; the administration&#8217;s response to lawmakers from both sides of the aisle who say President Biden still hasn&#8217;t gone far enough with sanctions?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Representative Adam Schiff yesterday said, quote, “…the administration must go further.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Senator Graham called the administration&#8217;s initial response “inadequate,” and he said, “Let&#8217;s quickly up our game.”<br><br>So what is the strategy behind holding back some of these larger sanction possibilities that you&#8217;ve talked about?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, our strategy has been start high, which is certainly what we did.&nbsp; We did not sanction a major bank or financial institution back in 2014.&nbsp; This is a farther step than that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As I noted a little bit earlier, we also sanctioned not just oligarchs but also family members around them to cut off their ability to preserve their funding and financing.&nbsp; And our approach and our strategy has been to preserve a range of sanctions and options that we can also escalate to, should we need to.</p>



<p>Obviously, our preference is that President Putin deescalates.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if Russia does invade further &#8212; as, you know, there are indications that it could &#8212; does that mean that those sanctions imposed yesterday, imposed today were a failure?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, part of them were a cost.&nbsp; Part of them is an effort to prevent a war.&nbsp; We&#8217;re doing that not alone but in coordination with our partners and Allies around the world.&nbsp; That is the way to do it.&nbsp; That is the strong way to do it.&nbsp; That is the effective way to do it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There may be others who have different points of view.&nbsp; They&#8217;re welcome.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a free country.&nbsp; They can have those points of view.</p>



<p>But our approach has been, to date, to respond with strong sanctions, to start high and build from there.&nbsp; And that is what we will continue to do if he escalates.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, lastly, on the Supreme Court nomination process, can you confirm that the interviews are now finished ahead of an announcement before the end of the month?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to confirm any details about the process.&nbsp; I would note that we are five days away from the end of February, if my math is correct.&nbsp; The interviews are typically late stage in the process.&nbsp; So, we are getting close to an announcement.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I want to ask about food prices.&nbsp; But, first, a quick question about Ukraine.&nbsp; Just a short while ago, separatists in eastern Ukraine formally asked President Putin for military help.&nbsp; Is that a signal that the U.S. expects a broader invasion is about to begin?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think as we&#8217;ve said from the beginning, there are going to be a range of false-flag operations that we have expected to and laid out the playbook to see.&nbsp; This is an example of it.&nbsp; That is suggesting that they feel under threat.&nbsp; By whom &#8212; the Ukrainians that the Russians are threatening to attack?&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we&#8217;ll continue to call out what we see as false-flag operations or efforts to spread disinformation about what the actual status is on the ground.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Americans, they just experienced their most expensive Thanksgiving.&nbsp; This conflict will likely drive up food prices, grocery prices.&nbsp; What does the White House minimizing the impact of even higher grocery prices actually look like?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve ever minimized the higher impact of the costs of food.&nbsp; I would note &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible) but you’re going to minimize the impact.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would note &#8212; let me finish.&nbsp; Factually, I think the price of a turkey just a couple of months ago was about $1 more, if we just look back at the facts of what was actually happening at the time.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve talked a bit in here about our concerns about meat conglomerates jacking up the prices &#8212; if people go into the store and they try to buy a pound or two pounds of meat &#8212; what we&#8217;re seeing as the impact of not enough competition in the industry.</p>



<p>But the President has repeatedly expressed concern about costs for the American people.&nbsp; That&#8217;s one of the reasons he continues to press for steps with Congress that will lower significant costs on people&#8217;s budgets, whether it&#8217;s childcare, healthcare, eldercare, whatever it may be.&nbsp; That is a central part of his economic agenda.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve said and the President has said several times that, you know &#8212; to Americans &#8212; that the U.S. is not sending the military into Ukraine, not going to war with Russia.&nbsp; And I just wanted to ask, given that your warning of a full-fledged invasion with potential attacks on Kyiv, how the administration is as confident as it is that that won&#8217;t become necessary at some point, that there won&#8217;t be any need down the road for military engagement with Russia?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That is not a decision the President is going to make.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We are not going to be in a war with Russia or putting military troops on the ground in Ukraine fighting Russia.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, ultimately, if Vladimir Putin takes all of Ukraine, that&#8217;s a situation that the administration is not &#8212; going to condemn, obviously; going to punish, economically &#8212; but that&#8217;s not something that will be engaged militarily.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, that is several steps down the road.&nbsp; But what I will tell you is the President has been crystal clear and consistent: He is not sending U.S. troops to fight in Ukraine.&nbsp; That has not changed.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has there been any discussion on the strategy of saying that, though, so publicly and potentially giving Putin an indication that the U.S. and NATO Allies are willing to cede that sphere of influence outside of NATO boundaries to him?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, I don’t know how many more times I can say it: There&#8217;s no scenario &#8212; the President is not sending U.S. troops to fight in Ukraine against Russia.&nbsp; We are taking a range of other steps, as you&#8217;ve touched on, but, I would say, they&#8217;re quite significant.</p>



<p>Not only are we the largest provider of security assistance, humanitarian assistance, and economic assistance to Ukraine, but we have also taken significant steps to plus up not only our NATO forces and our force posture but the force posture of our partners in Eastern Europe to make sure they know we have their backs and support them.</p>



<p>We will continue to plus this all up.&nbsp; But the President is not sending U.S. troops to fight in Ukraine.&nbsp; That hasn&#8217;t changed.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a little bit related to Eli&#8217;s&nbsp;question.&nbsp; So, it&#8217;s very clear what Russian escalation could be, right?&nbsp; Go from today to, you know, the whole of Ukraine, or bombarding Kyiv, or &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot of things along the way.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ve laid out all sorts of different sanctions that are being considered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what is the arc &#8212; because it&#8217;s very clear what the Russian arc could be, right?&nbsp; It could ultimately go to whatever, you know, occupying the whole of Ukraine.&nbsp; What is the arc of the U.S. response?&nbsp; Like what&#8217;s &#8212; what&#8217;s the equivalent to, you know, smashing Kyiv to pieces?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, I&#8217;m not going to outline &#8220;if this, then that&#8221; from here.&nbsp; And I &#8212; unless you know something the rest of us don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t know that anyone knows exactly what the next step will be.</p>



<p>As much as we&#8217;re preparing, we&#8217;re seeing them positioning their military forces for attack.&nbsp; Obviously, until they further invade, they haven&#8217;t further invaded, right?&nbsp; If they do and take escalatory steps, we will take escalatory steps.&nbsp; What those look like will depend a lot on what the actions are.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And one other question, please.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got the G7 virtual meeting tomorrow.&nbsp; The President has made a lot of outreach to allies, obviously.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is any consideration whatsoever being given to some kind of last-ditch outreach to the Russians, either from the President or him encouraging the Europeans to have another go at it?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;ve talked about this a little bit yesterday.&nbsp; I mean, a couple of days ago, obviously, the President made clear &#8212; or we made clear on his behalf that if they didn&#8217;t invade, that he was open to ha- &#8212; engaging with President Putin, and that would follow a meeting or engagement between our Secretary of State and Foreign Minister Lavrov.</p>



<p>Obviously, we&#8217;re in a different point at this point in time, and it doesn&#8217;t feel appropriate or the right step to have those diplomatic engagements right now.&nbsp; We will always leave the door open.&nbsp; If they de-escalate, we will certainly proceed with diplomatic engagement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, no, we&#8217;re not considering a meeting with President Putin or engagement with him right now.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, I have a question on Mexico but, first, on Ukraine &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the sanctions on Nord Stream AG, can you confirm that they will only affect gas from and not the four European companies that are shareholders of the consortium?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think we put out an extensive statement on this, as well as some details.&nbsp; I can &#8212; let me see if I can just outline it all from you &#8212; from here, and we can get that to you after the briefing as well.</p>



<p>What was your other question?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, on Mexico, the President of Mexico said today that the U.S. isn&#8217;t well informed about violence against journalists in Mexico and the recent impunity for those crimes.&nbsp; Are you worried that he&#8217;s downplaying the risks that journalists face in that country?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say, first, we&#8217;ve seen, factually, the threats that have been posed to journalists in Mexico.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve seen the threats, we&#8217;ve seen &#8212; and that is a concern that I think the Secretary of State was expressing on behalf of the United States about those abuses.&nbsp; So, I think he was speaking to facts we&#8217;ve seen on the ground.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, Jen.&nbsp; A couple of domestic questions for you.&nbsp; First, does the White House have any reaction to the order from Texas Governor Abbott calling for prosecutions of parents who move forward with gender-affirming treatments for their kids?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I spoke a little bit, unfortunately, to another law that we saw moving in Florida just last week.&nbsp; And &#8212; but let me reiterate some of the points I made then.</p>



<p>There are efforts in some states &#8212; not just Texas, but also Florida and unfortunately others &#8212; designed to target and attack the kids who need support the most: LGBTQI+ students who are already vulnerable to bullying and violence just for being themselves.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t an isolated action, as is evidenced by multiple states pursuing this.&nbsp; We&#8217;re seeing Republican leaders take actions to regulate what students can or cannot read, what they can or cannot learn, and, most troubling, who they can or cannot be.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ve heard the President &#8212; he also, I think, put out a tweet or &#8212; I think &#8212; or a statement to the Florida law.&nbsp; And I would say we have the same concerns about these type of actions we&#8217;re seeing in Texas.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, in Florida, Governor DeSantis&#8217;s administration is moving forward with the rule targeting shelters that house unaccompanied minors.&nbsp; Does the Biden administration have any contingency plans for the unaccompanied minors who may be affected by that rule, in terms of their</p>



<p>housing?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think this is an important thing to call &#8212; to call out here, because what we&#8217;re talking about here is, one, it&#8217;s our view &#8212; it&#8217;s our responsibility, I should say, as an administration to responsibly and safely care for unaccompanied children.&nbsp; We&#8217;re talking about minor kids here.</p>



<p>So HHS is currently examining all legal options available at its disposal to ensure that our shelters continue to provide services to the unaccompanied minor &#8212; minors in our care.</p>



<p>I would remind you all that there have been kids in Florida in these facilities since 2005 &#8212; I mean, these facilities have been open for 17 years now, being overseen by the Office of Refugee Resettlement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we&#8217;re obviously looking at legal options here.&nbsp; But I also would say this is &#8212; you know, really flies in the face of what should be a moral view of anyone that taking &#8212; caring for &#8212; the safe care for unaccompanied children should be a part of what we all want to be active participants in.<br><br>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; So, the Justice Department today announced that they are ending the Trump administration&#8217;s 2018 China Initiative and replacing it with a broader approach towards, you know, more countries &#8212; Russia, Iran, North Korea.</p>



<p>I know that Justice officials have spoken about this, but if you can elaborate from this podium the reasoning behind that, and especially in addressing the complaints of discrimination from Asian Americans.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would have to dig further into this, Patsy.&nbsp; I&#8217;d really point you to the Department of Justice.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure we have more to add from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, just on the global pandemic response, can you confirm the amount of funding that the administration has requested from Congress?&nbsp; We&#8217;re hearing this number of $5 billion that activists say is not nearly enough to help vaccinate the world, as well as to stop new variants from, you know, attacking the U.S. as well.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I don&#8217;t &#8212; well, I don&#8217;t have any specific numbers; we&#8217;re still in conversation with the Hill at this point about funding and funding needs, both domestically and internationally.</p>



<p>We want to continue to be the provider of not just vaccines but vaccine know-how and assistance to the global community.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t believe that COVI- &#8212; that the pandemic sees borders.&nbsp; And we know that in order to continue to get it under control, we need to be the leader in the world on this effort.&nbsp; But numbers are still being discussed with the Hill, so I don&#8217;t have any more specifics, unfortunately.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just really quickly on Ukraine: Are you, at this point, urging Americans to leave Russia?&nbsp; I know that &#8212; I think, two days ago the embassy in Moscow is issuing an advisory saying &#8212; for Americans to have evacuation plans that do not rely on government assistance.&nbsp; But are you actually telling Americans in Russia to leave Russia right now?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The State Department makes those assessments and recommendations, and they update them regularly, so I&#8217;d point to them for any updates.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; A few on Ukraine.&nbsp; First, the Kremlin has vowed countersanctions in response to the U.S.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve not seen what those will look like, but it sounds like the U.S. has quite a bit of intelligence, so I&#8217;m wondering if you have any view on what the nature of those countersanctions could be, what impact they could have on consumers, and how the administration could offset that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;ve seen those threats or those reports, but I don&#8217;t have anything to provide or assess from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, yesterday, President Biden said, “Nothing in Putin’s lengthy remarks indicated any interest in pursuing real dialogue on European security in the year 2022.”<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If that’s the case, what do you see as the endgame here?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, again, our hope is that Putin will decide to de-escalate: that he will feel the threat of the sanctions, what the impact will be on the Russian economy, on the Russian people, on the people who surround him &#8212; they are meant to have a deterrent impact; that he will feel the weight of being a pariah in the global community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It does not mean &#8212; we have never closed the door to diplomacy, and the President didn&#8217;t have that intention of conveying that yesterday either.&nbsp; And, certainly, if it is an appropriate time, he will engage with President Putin again.&nbsp; But now is not the appropriate time, where he&#8217;s continuing to invade a sovereign country.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, finally, the administration is working on putting its budget together.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much humanitarian assistance for Ukraine is the administration prepared to support?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s a good question.&nbsp; What we&#8217;re going to &#8212; and it&#8217;s hard for me to give you a number right now, because we&#8217;re going to continue to assess the needs on the &#8212; on the ground.&nbsp; And we certainly are prepared for the potential for there to be major humanitarian &#8212; continued humanitarian needs on the ground.&nbsp; Obviously, those existed &#8212; have existed since back to 2014.</p>



<p>But we want to continue to be the largest provider of humanitarian assistance.&nbsp; This is something we will continue to discuss with colleagues in Congress as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thanks everyone.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll do this again tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supreme Court, Jen?&nbsp; Supreme Court, real fast, Jen?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes, ma&#8217;am.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And going back to what Peter asked &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This &#8212; this small window &#8212; and in the midst of this window, you have a lot going on with foreign policy.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We do.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It means you guys have a lot going on, too.&nbsp; All of us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; How about that?&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that said, how is the President feeling in the midst of all this as it relates to this impending nomination &#8212; this historic nomination that he&#8217;s getting ready for make?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; And tell me more about what you mean, &#8220;How is he feeling?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is he feeling?&nbsp; I mean, he&#8217;s got all of this going on &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; with Ukraine and Russia.&nbsp; And then he&#8217;s got this historic nomination of the first Black woman to potentially sit on the U.S. Supreme Court.&nbsp; It&#8217;s history being made in the midst of looking at sanctions and other things that are happening overseas.&nbsp; How&#8217;s he feeling about this piece over here?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes, I mean, I think the President is looking forward to announcing a historic, eminently qualified Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court.&nbsp; He has &#8212; feels there&#8217;s tremendous honor in that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He takes the role that every President has in selecting and nominating someone to the Supreme Court very seriously.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why he has been spending time not just studying bios, but also reviewing cases and engaging very closely with an internal team on this process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But he is very much looking forward to making this announcement and getting this individual confirmed.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many nominees has he met with thus far?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to get into further detail on that.&nbsp; I expect once he makes an announcement, we&#8217;ll have more details to share.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And lastly &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; the administration has been fervrent &#8212; fervor &#8212; fervent &#8212; I can&#8217;t even get the word out &#8212; saying that they will &#8212; that you all will fight against anyone who tries to mar or ruin the reputation of any of these nominees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are you willing to do in this fight to keep their reputations that they walked into this process with?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s a good question, April.&nbsp; I think what we mean by that is: There are a range of eminently qualified Black women whose names have been out there as potential nominees &#8212; all of these women would make tremendous additions to the Supreme Court &#8212; and we have also seen efforts to mar their reputations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what we mean by that is we are going to fight back &#8212; even before, obviously, the President has made a decision or made an announcement &#8212; against efforts to tar any of their reputations.&nbsp; That means defending them publicly, standing up for them, providing information to &#8212; to, you know, debunk any information that&#8217;s being put out about them that&#8217;s inaccurate.&nbsp; And hopefully they all feel that we have &#8212; we have delivered on that promise.&nbsp; But that has been important to the President from the beginning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Thank you, everyone.&nbsp; See you tomorrow or whenever.</p>

<p>Since Russia began deploying troops to the Ukrainian border, the United States has worked closely with our Allies and partners to deliver a strong, unified response. As I said when I met with Chancellor Scholz earlier this month, Germany has been a leader in that effort, and we have closely coordinated our efforts to stop the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if Russia further invaded Ukraine.</p>



<p>Yesterday, after further close consultations between our two governments, Germany announced that it would halt certification of the pipeline. Today, I have directed my administration to impose sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG and its corporate officers. These steps are another piece of our initial tranche of sanctions in response to Russia’s actions in Ukraine. As I have made clear, we will not hesitate to take further steps if Russia continues to escalate.</p>



<p>Through his actions, President Putin has provided the world with an overwhelming incentive to move away from Russian gas and to other forms of energy. I want to thank Chancellor Scholz for his close partnership and continued dedication to holding Russia accountable for its actions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Since President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 100 days ago, the Biden-Harris Administration has made major progress implementing the largest long-term investment in America’s infrastructure and competitiveness in nearly a century.</p>



<p>The historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild crumbling road and bridges, replace lead pipes, help provide high-speed internet to every family in America, and produce concrete results that change people’s lives for the better. By reaching all communities all across the country – including rural communities and historically underserved populations – these investments will position the United States to win the 21st century.</p>



<p>Upon signing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, President Biden signed an Executive Order establishing an Infrastructure Implementation Task Force that has now met nine times to ensure that the Administration is delivering results to the American people.<br>The Administration has demonstrated early and often how we will work as one team with one mission: to build a better America while creating good-paying job opportunities for American workers, ensuring products are Made in America and strengthening supply chains, advancing racial equity, and strengthening the nation’s resilience to climate change.</p>



<p>Since the bill signing, implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has been the focus of more than 60 presidential and cabinet visits to communities across America. The President, Vice President, and Cabinet have traveled the country to showcase how the Administration is building a better America and how the law benefits communities in every corner of the country.<br><strong><br>Resources for States, Territories, Tribes, &amp; Local Governments<br></strong><br>In January, the White House released the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.build.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>first edition of its Bipartisan Infrastructure Law guidebook</strong></a>&nbsp;to help state, local, Tribal and territorial governments unlock the benefits from the historic investments in our nation’s infrastructure. The guidebook is a central repository on the law and contains the most comprehensive information to date on the more than 375 programs included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.&nbsp;Along with its accompanying information online, states, territories, Tribes and local governments now have information on funding opportunities, who to contact, and how to get ready to rebuild. Future phases of the guidebook will update dates, key timelines for program implementation, best practices, case studies, and links to key resources developed by the White House and partners. In recent weeks, the Administration has launched an <strong>“Infrastructure School”</strong> webinar series to go more in depth into each of the guidebook’s 12 chapters and allow communities the opportunity to ask questions to the agency experts, overseeing implementation of key programs.</p>



<p>Given that over 90 percent of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding will be implemented by non-federal partners, the White House has requested <a href="https://www.ibtta.org/sites/default/files/documents/Advocacy/GA053-Mitch%20Landrieu%20Letter%20to%20Governors%202022-0104.pdf">Governors</a>&nbsp;and local leaders take a series of preparatory actions, including appointing infrastructure coordinators to manage the flow of funds to their states. The Administration has also released a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BIL-Factsheet-Local-Competitive-Funding.pdf">fact sheet</a> on some of the largest sources of competitive funding, particularly for local governments. Senior Advisor and Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator Mitch Landrieu has shared these resources during meetings with the National Governors Association, U.S. Conference of Mayors, National League of Cities, National Association of Counties, and hundreds of tribes through Tribal Consultations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While many funding streams in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law specifically set aside funds for underserved communities, the White House Infrastructure Implementation Team has also been engaging states, local governments, Tribal governments, territories, federal agencies, philanthropy, and others to leverage all available resources to quickly deliver the necessary technical assistance and capacity to underserved communities.</p>



<p><strong>Good Stewards of Taxpayer Dollars</strong><br>As outlined in the President’s executive order, agencies must prioritize “investing public dollars efficiently and equitably, working to avoid waste, and focusing on measurable outcomes for the American people.” To support effective agency implementation, transparency, and appropriate oversight, key Biden-Harris Administration officials have met with the Inspectors General for agencies with major Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding and leaders of the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Going forward, the Administration will work with agency IGs and GAO to share data and effective practices so that program planning, design, execution, and financial management, as well as data, tracking, and reporting, support transparency and help ensure taxpayer dollars are spent well.</p>



<p><strong>Delivering On Time, On Task, On Budget</strong><br>Nearly $100 billion has been announced to states, territories, Tribes and local governments from formula and competitive programs for roads and highways, bridges, ports, airports, and water systems. Another nearly $50 billion in RFIs and notices of funding availability have been released. The Administration has also unveiled new offices and action plans that will ensure these investments are implemented wisely and well.</p>

<p>One year ago, the United States and Canada reaffirmed the special nature of our relationship, and our commitment to working closely together in the interests of the collective security and prosperity of our citizens based on the principles of democracy, diversity, and equity. The Roadmap for a Renewed U.S.-Canada Partnership guides our work, and lays out an ambitious framework to build a greener, more prosperous future; grow our economies and strengthen the middle class; combat the global COVID-19 pandemic; create safer, more equitable communities; and stand together in the face of threats to democracy.  Defending democracy is at the heart of our commitment to stand with Ukraine in the face of Russia’s unprovoked invasion.  We have made progress over the past year and laid the foundation to deepen our cooperation on climate change, on supporting the global pandemic response efforts, on enhancing cooperation on the Arctic, and on building the economies of the future, including through work to strengthen bilateral supply chains and cooperation on critical minerals. Much work remains to be done.  Our countries are both stronger when we work together towards our shared objectives.  We look forward to building on the enduring partnership between our two great nations in the years ahead.</p>

<p>Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)<br><br>Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the <em>Federal Register</em> and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the <em>Federal Register</em> for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to Cuba that was declared on March 1, 1996, in Proclamation 6867, as amended by Proclamation 7757 on February 26, 2004, Proclamation 9398 on February 24, 2016, and Proclamation 9699 on February 22, 2018, is to continue in effect beyond March 1, 2022.<br><br>There remains a need to continue this national emergency, based on a disturbance or threatened disturbance of the international relations for the United States related to Cuba.  The unauthorized entry of any United States-registered vessel into Cuban territorial waters continues to be detrimental to the foreign policy of the United States.<br><br>The unauthorized entry of vessels subject to the jurisdiction of the United States into Cuban territorial waters is currently a violation of Federal law.  Further, the unauthorized entry of United States-registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters continues to be detrimental to United States foreign policy and counter to the purpose of Executive Order 12807, which is to ensure, among other things, safe, orderly, and legal migration.  The possibility of large-scale unauthorized entries of United States-registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters would disturb the international relations of the United States regarding Cuba by allowing for or providing the means to facilitate a mass migration of Cuban nationals and threatening our national security.<br><br>Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency with respect to Cuba and the emergency authority relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of vessels set out in Proclamation 6867, as amended by Proclamation 7757, Proclamation 9398, and Proclamation 9699.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>On March 1, 1996, by Proclamation 6867, a national emergency was declared to address the disturbance or threatened disturbance of international relations caused by the February&nbsp;24,&nbsp;1996, destruction by the Cuban government of two unarmed, United States-registered civilian aircraft in international airspace north of Cuba. &nbsp;On February&nbsp;26,&nbsp;2004, by Proclamation 7757, the national emergency was expanded to deny monetary and material support to the Cuban government. &nbsp;On February&nbsp;24,&nbsp;2016, by Proclamation 9398, and on February 22, 2018, by Proclamation 9699, the national emergency was further modified based on continued disturbances or threatened disturbances of the international relations of the United States related to Cuba. &nbsp;The Cuban government has not demonstrated that it will refrain from the use of excessive force against United States vessels or aircraft that may engage in memorial activities or peaceful protest north of Cuba.</p>



<p>Further, the unauthorized entry of any United States-registered vessel into Cuban territorial waters continues to be detrimental to the foreign policy of the United States because such entry could facilitate a mass migration from Cuba. &nbsp;It continues to be&nbsp;United States policy that a mass migration from Cuba would endanger United States&nbsp;national security by posing a disturbance or threatened disturbance of the international relations of the United States.</p>



<p>Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with respect to Cuba and the emergency authority relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of vessels set out in Proclamation 6867, as amended by Proclamation 7757, Proclamation 9398, and Proclamation 9699.</p>



<p>This notice shall be published in the <em>Federal Register </em>and transmitted to the Congress.</p>

SINGH:&nbsp; Russia&#8217;s long-previewed invasion of Ukraine has begun and so, too, has our response.&nbsp; Today, the President responded swiftly and in lockstep with Allies and partners.&nbsp; The speed and coordination was historic.&nbsp; In previous sanctions regimes, it took weeks and months to mount a decisive response. This time, we announced our first tranche of sanctions in less than a day and in lockstep with Allies and partners in the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Australia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let me say a few words about the details of the package.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(A cellphone disrupts the briefing.)</p>



<p>First &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no easy segue from that.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sanctions &#8212;</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp;&nbsp;(Laughs.)&nbsp; Close your ears.</p>



<p>First, after consultations overnight with Germany, Russia&#8217;s Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline will not become operational.&nbsp; That&#8217;s an $11 billion investment in a prized gas pipeline controlled by Russia that will now go to waste, and it sacrifices what would have been a cash cow for Russia&#8217;s coffers.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s not just about the money.&nbsp; This decision will relieve Russia&#8217;s geostrategic chokehold over Europe through its supply of gas, and it&#8217;s a major turning point in the world&#8217;s energy independence from Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, we&#8217;ve demonstrated the potency of our financial sanctions.&nbsp; And make &#8212; make no mistake: This is only the sharp edge of the pain we can inflict.</p>



<p>In lockstep with our Allies, we&#8217;re fully blocking from the global financial system the fifth-largest Russian financial institution, V.E.B.&nbsp; This is a glorified piggybank for the Kremlin that holds more than $50 billion in assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re also fully blocking Promsvyazbank.&nbsp; This is a bank that holds $35 billion in assets that finances the activities of the Russian military.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In plain English, full &#8212; full block means these banks can no longer make any transactions with the U.S. nor with Europe, as Europe matched our actions, and their assets in our respective financial systems will be frozen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And let me be totally clear: No Russian financial institution is safe if the invasion proceeds.&nbsp; We are ready to press a button to take action on the two largest Russian financial institutions, which collectively hold almost $750 billion in assets &#8212; or more than half of the total in the Russian banking system.</p>



<p>Third, together with our Allies, we&#8217;ve also cut off the Russian government, the Russian Central Bank, and Russian sovereign wealth funds from new financing from the U.S. and Europe.&nbsp; The Kremlin can no longer raise money from the U.S. or Europe, and its new debt can no longer trade on U.S. or European financial markets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fourth, we have fully sanctioned a group of Russian elites and their family members.&nbsp; These individuals share in the corrupt gains of the Kremlin, and they will now share in the pain.&nbsp; Other Russian elites and their family members are now on notice that additional actions could be taken on them as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also want to take a minute to address a key part of the President&#8217;s speech on energy markets.&nbsp; We were deliberate to direct the pain of our sanctions towards the Russian economy, not ours.&nbsp; None of our measures are designed to disrupt the flow of energy to global markets.&nbsp; And we are now executing a plan in coordination with major oil producers and major oil consumers to secure the stability of global energy supplies.</p>



<p>Let me just end where I started: This was the beginning of an invasion, and this is the beginning of our response.&nbsp; The actions we took today were only the first tranche.</p>



<p>If Putin escalates further, we will escalate further using financial sanctions and export controls, which we&#8217;ve yet to unveil but which are fully prepared to implement with Allies and partners across the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, make no mistake: Our response goes well beyond sanctions and export controls.&nbsp; We&#8217;re continuing to fortify NATO&#8217;s eastern flank to reinforce our sacred Article 5 commitment to defend every inch of NATO territory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just today, the President announced that additional troops and equipment will be shifted within Europe to the Baltics.&nbsp; We’ll continue to provide defensive assistance to Ukraine.</p>



<p>Already, over the past year, we&#8217;ve provided $650 <s>billion</s> [million] to this effect &#8212; the most of any year.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll continue to work with Allies and partners to provide economic assistance to Ukraine with the ide- &#8212; idea being: We want to create a successful alternative in Ukraine to Russian-style kleptocracy, which may be Putin&#8217;s greatest fear of all.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Josh.</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Can you speak a little bit more about the energy component?&nbsp; What tools do you have in the tool chest, given that there&#8217;s been an effort ongoing now for several months to control the price increases that we’re seeing for gasoline in particular?&nbsp; What can you do to help energy prices not spike the way that President Biden appears to worry that will?</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; So this is an ongoing effort and a sensitive effort.&nbsp; I can give you a bit &#8212; a bit of detail on what that involves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Number one, it involves coordinating our actions with major energy <s>producers</s> [consumers].  We all have reserves at our disposal, and those reserves could help support the supply of energy worldwide. </p>



<p>Number two, we&#8217;re working closely with major energy producers.&nbsp; Many of them have &#8212; several of them have the spare capacity to provide supply to global energy markets and to balance the market in the event of any supply disruption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Number three, we can work with energy companies to surge their capacity to supply energy to the market, particularly as prices rise.</p>



<p>And number four, we can be very clear that if President Putin weaponizes energy supply, it will be met with massive consequences and it will only accelerate the diversification of Europe and the world away from Russian energy.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And can you speak, quickly, to the decision to what seems to be delinking the sanctions?&nbsp; Initially, the President was signaling if there is an invasion or a further invasion that the sanctions would come full stop, one swoop.&nbsp; Now we&#8217;re seeing, sort of, more of a tit-for-tat approach.&nbsp; You&#8217;re warning here today that if President Putin goes further, so will the sanctions.<br><br>Can you walk us through that process at all?&nbsp; It seems like the U.S. is now breaking its sanction package into chunks, whereas the expectation had been that it would come all at once.</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Well, look, today&#8217;s package is a severe action &#8212; I walked through the elements of it &#8212; with Nord Stream, the financial sanctions, sovereign debt, and the elites.&nbsp;<br><br>Number two, it&#8217;s just the beginning.&nbsp; This was the beginning of an invasion; this is just the beginning of our response.<br><br>But number three &#8212; and this really gets to your question, I think, most fundamentally: No one should think that it&#8217;s our goal to max out on sanctions.&nbsp; Sanctions are not an end to themselves.&nbsp; They serve a higher purpose.&nbsp; And that purpose is to deter and prevent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They&#8217;re meant to prevent and deter a large-scale invasion of Ukraine that could involve the seizure of major cities, including Kyiv.&nbsp; They&#8217;re meant to prevent large-scale human suffering that could involve tens of thousands of casualties in a conflict.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re meant to prevent the installation of a puppet government, controlled by Moscow, that subjugates the will of Ukraine and prevents the people of Ukraine from choosing their own destiny and setting their own course.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what this is all about.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:  Cecilia.<br><br>Q    What&#8217;s it going to take to target Putin directly?</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not do that today?<br><br>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to telegraph exactly what it would take and under what circumstances that would occur.&nbsp; But no option is off the table, as the President said.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the EU President said today “this is the most dangerous moment in European security in a generation.”&nbsp; So if not today, when?&nbsp; What?<br><br>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; Look, as I say, we mounted a very significant response today; we can escalate that response further.&nbsp; There are a number of actions we can take using financial sanctions, export controls, fortifying our eastern flank, helping Ukraine defend itself, helping each other deal with the costs and consequences of Russia&#8217;s invasion, and, most importantly, having a shared confidence among Allies in our way of life, our economic model, our political model.<br><br>If Russia wants to sequester itself from Western technology, the Western economy, and from Western financial markets, that is a bad strategic choice for Russia.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re going to step up in solidarity to advance our values and principles.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Zeke.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; You mentioned that sanctions are meant to deter and prevent, but the fact of the matter is the sanctions you&#8217;re announcing today and announced last night did not deter or prevent Russia&#8217;s actions yesterday and over the weekend.&nbsp; What gives you any confidence that the remaining sanctions that haven&#8217;t been imposed yet can deter or prevent a further Russian invasion and aggression in Ukraine?</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; Well, look, it&#8217;s &#8212; it&#8217;s day one.&nbsp; And President Putin has choices to make; we have choices to make.&nbsp; Our job is to manage risks and to impose consequences for a further escalation of this conflict by President Putin.&nbsp;<br><br>We can do that through financial sanctions.&nbsp; We can do that through export controls.&nbsp; We can do that through fortifying NATO&#8217;s eastern flank.&nbsp; We can do that through providing defensive assistance to Ukraine.&nbsp; We can do that by being prepared for any energy market impact that occurs from Russia&#8217;s choices.&nbsp; Those are the choices that are within our disposal.&nbsp;<br><br>And let me just take a step back and talk about sanctions.&nbsp; You know, we have principles that matter in terms of how we design a sanctions package.&nbsp; They need to be powerful enough to demonstrate our resolve and the capacity to impose overwhelming costs.&nbsp; They should be calibrated such that we can maximize coordination with our Allies and partners.&nbsp; They should maintain flexibility so we can escalate or deescalate depending on what Putin does.&nbsp; They should be responsible so that we avoid unwanted spillovers to the U.S. and global economy.&nbsp; And they need to be sustainable.&nbsp; They work over time, not on day one.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Weijia is going to have to be the last one.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Singh, can you tell us why Putin himself was not sanctioned?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; So just to follow up &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, I know you&#8217;re trying to explain &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Weijia is going to ask a question.&nbsp; Simon, you got &#8212;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; because when you are doing it by &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Simon, you got a question last week.&nbsp; So we’re just trying to diversify it a little bit.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, I just wanted to &#8212;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can we have an answer to that one, though?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Simon, can you let Weijia ask a question?&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Go ahead, Weijia.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I know that you just talked about all the actions that you&#8217;re taking to counter any oil shortages that might drive up gas prices.&nbsp; But today, the President himself was very blunt about how they could impact Americans.&nbsp; So can you just give us a sense of when Americans might feel a difference when they fill up their gas tanks?<br><br>And then, secondly, to follow up on what Zeke was just asking, both you and the President said today that these sanctions will be in response, will be &#8212; if Putin escalates, you will escalate.&nbsp; So that sounds like they are going to be in response now and not meant to deter.&nbsp; So do you still view them as being a deterrence, or are they just a punishment at this point?</p>



<p>MR. SINGH:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; So the first question on energy markets and the impact of our actions and when they&#8217;ll take effect in markets: Look, again, I &#8212; I don&#8217;t want to go into specifics, but there are actions that energy consumers can take with their strategic reserves.&nbsp; There are actions that energy producers can take in terms of their spare capacity.&nbsp; There are actions that energy producers can undertake to increase their production of energy in the current circumstance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I&#8217;m not going to give you a timeline, but the collective power of those actions and all the other tools and authorities that are at our disposal, plus diplomatic maneuvers that are at &#8212; that are at our disposal &#8212; collectively, we think, will be effective in bringing down the price of gas and the price of oil.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Thank you, Daleep.&nbsp; Thank you so much for joining us.&nbsp; He will come back, I promise.&nbsp; And I promised he would not be too late for his meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;So thank you so much for joining us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Okay.&nbsp; I apologize to those of you who did not get questions from Daleep.&nbsp; We will have him back, and we will make him available in other capacities as well to all of you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have one very unrelated no- &#8212; but still very important item for you at the top, and then we&#8217;ll get back to our discussion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today in Arizona, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland announced the Interior Department&#8217;s plan to fulfill settlements of Indian water rights claims using historic funding from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.</p>



<p>The Infrastructure Law provides $2.5 billion to implement the Indian Water Rights Settlement Completion Fund, which will help deliver long-promised water resources to Tribes and a foundation for future economic development for entire communities dependent on common water resources.</p>



<p>Following feedback from the Tribal consul- &#8212; from Tribal consultations, the Department will allocate $1.7 billion this year alone from the Infrastructure Law to enact &#8212; to enacted settlements that have outstanding federal payments necessary to complete their terms.</p>



<p>With that, Zeke, why don’t you kick us off.&nbsp; And we will get around to as many people as possible, and I realize it&#8217;s already late.&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; If you could walk through the events of the last 24 hours.&nbsp; Last night, a senior administration official on a background call with reporters briefed &#8212; a briefing on the administration&#8217;s response and said that Russia has occupied these regions since 2014 and that Russian troops moving into the Donbas would not in and of &#8212; would not &#8212; it would not itself be a new step and didn&#8217;t use the word “invasion.”</p>



<p>This morning, the Deputy National Security Advisor said “invasion,” and the President is using “invasion.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>What changed in the last 24 hours?&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you see on the ground that changed the U.S. government&#8217;s assessment of what is actually happening in eastern Ukraine?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m not going &#8212; I know this isn&#8217;t exactly what you&#8217;re asking.&nbsp; But just to set the precedent here, I&#8217;m not going to be confirming military movements from the podium now or at any point probably.&nbsp; But what I can tell you is what we looked at is the events of the last less than 24 hours, Zeke.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; And what we have seen is President Putin setting up a rationale to take more territory by force.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we&#8217;re basing that on &#8212; including the comments of the Deputy National Security Advisor this morning and then the President&#8217;s comments later in the afternoon &#8212; is a couple of things: One, Vladimir Putin announced yesterday that he was basically planning to carve out a chunk of Ukraine by recognizing two regions of Ukraine as independent.&nbsp; He brazenly asserted these regions are no longer part of Ukrainian sovereign territory.&nbsp; Last night, he authorized Russian forces to deploy into these regions.&nbsp; Today, he sought authorizations &#8212; authorization from the Duma for the Russian military to use force outside of Russian territory.&nbsp; And today, he asserted that these regions actually extend deeper into Ukraine, claiming larger areas currently under jurisdiction of the Ukrainian government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what we&#8217;re seeing there &#8212; and as for anybody who read or paid attention to his lengthy speech last night &#8212; is the rationale to go much further.&nbsp; That is what we are also watching very closely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this com- &#8212; for this combination of reasons, we see this as the beginning of a further invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp; But we look at and we assess over the course of a short period of time.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And &#8212; but right now, could you say whether or not the U.S. government believes that there&#8217;s been additional deployments of Russian forces &#8212; active forces &#8212; across the border into Ukraine?&nbsp; They’ve been there for years, but additional forces.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to get into military assessments of military movements from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then on a separate topic, the President &#8212; Daleep talked to this as well &#8212; warned Americans over the last several weeks that they have to &#8212; they should be prepared to bear the cost of standing up for Ukraine’s sovereignty.&nbsp; And, you know, there&#8217;s been a lot of conversation about this.&nbsp; And I was hoping you could maybe speak to &#8212; clarify this a little bit: Why should Americans, you know, feel that they have to &#8212; you know, that is a cost that they should have to bear and that should affect their lives?&nbsp; And how much should they be prepared for this, you know, geopolitical crisis to impact their day-to-day living?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think what, hopefully, the American people who are tuning into this or have been tuning into this will see is that the President of the United States and his entire national security apparatus have been rallying the world and standing up against the efforts of Russia to invade and take &#8212; and carve out a chunk of another country for their own.&nbsp; And that is &#8212; the world is standing with the United States against the actions of President Putin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, why does that matter?  I realize that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re asking me.  Why does that matter to the American people?  That should matter because that is a fundamental value that we, as a country, stand up for, and we stand up against that type of action.  That goes back to World War Two.  And we have repeatedly throughout history been leaders in the world in rallying support <s>for</s> [against] any efforts to seize territory from another country. </p>



<p>What the &#8212; when the President spoke to the American people last week, it was very important to him to be very direct and clear and straightforward with them about what this could mean as we looked to what the impact of an invasion could mean and also what the impact of sanctions could mean, and the fact that standing up for values is not without cost, including in this case &#8212; including, potentially, in this scenario.</p>



<p>Now, as Daleep just conveyed, what the President has said to his national security team is he wants to leave no stone unturned.&nbsp; He wants them to take every step possible to tap into the resources of global suppliers, to present to him any option that will reduce the impact on the American people.&nbsp; And even as he&#8217;s looking at sanctions, he is taking that into account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this is about standing up for American values and making &#8212; and he wanted to make clear to them what impact that could have.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Given what Secretary Blinken just announced about his meeting with Lavrov on Thursday, is a summit between the President and Putin out of the question now?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;re never going to completely close the door to diplomacy, and I don&#8217;t think the Secretary of State did that either.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But just to build on what he just said, diplomacy can&#8217;t succeed unless Russia changes course.&nbsp; And as he said, it wouldn&#8217;t be appropriate for him to have a meeting with his counterpart at this point in time &#8212; Foreign Minister Lavrov. And it was always intended that any engagement with President Putin would follow that.</p>



<p>So, at this point, that is certainly not in the plans.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what would &#8212; what would it take to get that conversation back to the table &#8212; to reconsider a meeting between the two leaders?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, de-escalation.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s what it would take.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which &#8212; which &#8212; how do you define that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; “De-escalation” means moving troops.&nbsp; It means de-escalating from what the steps they continue to take on a daily basis appear to be.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then a second topic, quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many Supreme Court nominees has the President interviewed by this point?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; (Winks at the press.)&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; That was a wink.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I appreciate your question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does that mean three?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I understand, Weijia, why you&#8217;re asking.&nbsp; We are, of course, a very short period of time away from the end of the month of February.&nbsp; The President has not made a decision about who he is going to nominate, but I&#8217;m not &#8212; still not going to get into details about the internal process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; More to tell soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead, Peter.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; The President said in the spring that Pentagon generals had briefed him that the greatest threat facing America is global warming.&nbsp; Is that still the assessment now that we are facing down a potential cyber war with Russia?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I &#8212; let me first say: There is no &#8212; while we are always prepared for any threat that any outside entity or country poses to the United States as it relates to cyber or anything else, there is no current pending threat on &#8212; as it relates to cyber.</p>



<p>In terms of the threats you&#8217;re &#8212; you&#8217;re touching on, that was a briefing from the military, so I&#8217;d point you to them.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, as far as anybody watching who&#8217;s seen the coverage, it&#8217;s very &#8212; at times, distressing images of Russian military movements &#8212; the number-one threat facing the country right now remains global warming?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, Peter, I think it&#8217;s important, as we&#8217;re all educating the public here, to convey and reiterate: The President has no intention of sending U.S. troops into Ukraine to fight in Ukraine.&nbsp; What we are doing is we are abiding by our obligations to our NATO Allies and partners to ensure that they have the support and the resources that they need.&nbsp; And that is our right and our obligation as the United States.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And why do you guys think that sanctions are going to stop Putin if his goal ultimately is to redraw the map so it looks like it did 70 or 80 years ago?&nbsp; What sanction is going to stop him from doing that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think, just to kind of reiterate maybe something you touched on there &#8212; for anyone who watched his speech last night, what he made clear in that speech is that he doesn&#8217;t even necessarily &#8212; or doesn&#8217;t recognize the independence of Ukraine as a country.&nbsp; And that certainly gives us an indication of where his intentions are at this point in time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sanctions can be a powerful tool.&nbsp; They have been in a lot of moments throughout history.&nbsp; And what we view them as &#8212; or how we&#8217;re viewing them as we&#8217;re starting high, as Daleep just conveyed here, in terms of the significance and the severity of the sanctions that were announced today &#8212; yes, our intention is to have a deterrent effect.&nbsp; And there are &#8212; while what they have done to date is completely unacceptable, there are certainly far worse that could happen.&nbsp; What we want to do is prevent a large-scale invasion &#8212; death and destruction across Ukraine, devastation to the Ukrainian people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that what happens with the sanctions is they work over time.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not an end.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not intended to max out at the beginning.&nbsp; They&#8217;re long-lasting and sustainable, and they&#8217;re intended to squeeze.</p>



<p>But if you look at what is happening now, what President Putin has stated as his intention is he wants to divide NATO. The opposite of that has happened, Peter.&nbsp; He also wanted to &#8212; a geopolitical project, Nord Stream 2, to go forward; that has not happened.&nbsp; He wants to make sure there is a vibrant economy for the Russian people; they&#8217;re not on that track.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, his intentions and his objectives are not playing out.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But so, I guess, to follow up on that: The President said before he got here that “Putin knows, if I am President of the United States, his days of tyranny and trying to intimidate the United States and those in Eastern Europe are over.”&nbsp; It&#8217;s two and a half years later.&nbsp; He is intimidating the United States and those in Eastern Europe.&nbsp; What happened?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;d hardly put it that way.&nbsp; I would look at it, actually, from the prism of: The United States and President Biden has rallied the world, rallied Europe to stand up against the efforts and the actions of President Putin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You don’t think people who are totally strapped for cash &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; And we &#8212; we&#8217;ve laid out very clearly exactly &#8212;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; right now are intimidated by $4 gas, $5 gas, however high you guys think it&#8217;s going to go?&nbsp; Something like that is not intimidating?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You asked me if we were intimidated by President Putin, and I think the evidence of that doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>



<p>Go ahead, Kristen.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; If I can try one more time &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; on sanctions.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President of Ukraine on Saturday urged &#8212; called on the United States and its Allies to impose the toughest sanctions.&nbsp; And as all of these questions suggest, President Putin doesn&#8217;t seem to be deterred at this point.&nbsp; Why not choke him &#8212; Russia &#8212; out financially right now as a way to try to stop him?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, here&#8217;s how we and our national security team looks at sanctions &#8212; it&#8217;s a very good question; I think it&#8217;s actually a different one than what was asked &#8212; is we look at them through a couple of &#8212; for a couple of purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One, not that they are going to be an end on their own.&nbsp; Just the announcement of sanctions is not &#8212; is not going to have the immediate impact.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not intended to work that way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They&#8217;re not &#8212; we&#8217;re not &#8212; they&#8217;re not intended to max out at the beginning.&nbsp; This is why we&#8217;ve always intended to have a range of sanctions, steps that we could plus-up to or escalate to if his behavior and his actions continue to be escalatory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And also, if we do all the sanctions now, what is the deterrent effect or impact of preventing him to take further action?&nbsp; That is what &#8212; the conversation we&#8217;ve been in with the global community, and that is how we&#8217;ve been approaching it to date.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Lindsey Graham says President Biden is “missing the moment.”&nbsp; Does he run the risk of being too cautious here with this tranche approach?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We &#8212; in what capacity is he missing the moment?&nbsp; What did Senator Graham say?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lindsey Gra- &#8212; I&#8217;ll read you the entire &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay, go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; quote.&nbsp; “This is a critical moment in history…. President Biden is NOT seizing the moment.&nbsp; The sanctions outlined are woefully inadequate to deter Putin’s&#8221; &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Did he say that before or after we announced the sanctions?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&#8217;s been saying this consistently.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, look, I think it&#8217;s an important question because what we &#8212; what the President announced was the sanctioning of two enormous financial system &#8212; institutions that is essentially going to make it more difficult for people close to President Putin and in the Russian elite to do business.&nbsp; And this is just the beginning.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When do you think they&#8217;ll start to feel the impact? When will they feel the bite?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, they&#8217;re going to be imp- &#8212; they&#8217;re going to be implemented immediately.&nbsp; So, obviously, it takes some time, but our effort and our focus is on implementing them immediately. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And going back to President Biden&#8217;s statement that he wants to mitigate the impact on Americans: Can you tell Americans how much pain will they feel with this first tranche?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think what we&#8217;re looking at here, Kristen is, of course, the impact on natural gas <s>producers</s> [consumers] primarily is in Europe, and we&#8217;re working to help them too, but also on the oil markets. </p>



<p>And, obviously, there are many additional steps that President Putin could take, and what we&#8217;re seeing is that he has every intention of taking.&nbsp; So, I can&#8217;t give you a projection of that.&nbsp; Some of it depends on what the actions are.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But do you think Americans will feel the impact in the coming weeks of these round &#8212; this round of sanctions?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, it really depends on what the steps are.&nbsp; What &#8212; what was announced today was significant sanctions on Russian elite and on financial institutions there.</p>



<p>The people who will be largely impacted are in Russia on those.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I could just try one more.&nbsp; SWIFT &#8212; not in this initial rollout.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; In the ini- &#8212; not in the initial tranche, but remains on the table.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will it be in the next rollout if there needs to be another rollout?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I can&#8217;t give you a prediction of that.&nbsp; But again, we have a range of options that remain on the table significant &#8212; that would have a significant and devastating impact on the Russian economy.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve already seen, in the Russian economy, the impact on inflation there and on the markets there of the expectation of these &#8212; of these sanctions, but all of those options remain on the table, and I can&#8217;t make a prediction of what&#8217;s next.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, the President today used words like “bizarre” and “twisted” to describe Putin&#8217;s remarks.&nbsp; Does the administration believe &#8212; on what they saw in his speech yesterday or in the last 24 hours, if you will &#8212; that Putin has shown some kind of change in his state of mind, in his demeanor?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t say we&#8217;d characterize it that way, Cecilia.&nbsp; I mean, if you &#8212; for those of you who read or watched his speech last night &#8212; which was rife with historical inaccuracy, of course &#8212; he made clear that he does not view Ukraine &#8212; not just the areas he recognized yesterday, but the totality of Ukraine &#8212; as an independent country.</p>



<p>And he did &#8212; and he conveyed that by providing a lot of revisionist history details that are not aligned with what has happened over the last few decades.</p>



<p>Now, we&#8217;ve seen some of that rhetoric, if you look back &#8212; back to 2008, and even before then.&nbsp; But it is indicative of, you know, of his own belief that he has the right as &#8212; of Russia &#8212; and he has the right to take the territory, to claim territory from another country.&nbsp; And we just don&#8217;t agree with that, obviously.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if sanctions don&#8217;t work, then what?&nbsp; What else is in the toolbelt at the President&#8217;s disposal at this point?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, sanctions can take a number of formats.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; Export controls is certainly one of them.&nbsp; There&#8217;s many more sanctions that we have at our disposal.</p>



<p>SWIFT &#8212; the SWIFT system is obviously significant and not in the first tranche.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s a range of options that remain on the table for sanctions.</p>



<p>And again, as Daleep conveyed, but I think this is an important component for &#8212; to &#8212; to know is that they&#8217;re not intended to have an impact on the fir- &#8212; the harshest impact on the first day.&nbsp; They&#8217;re attempted &#8212; they&#8217;re planned or they&#8217;re designed to have a squeezing impact over the course of time.&nbsp; And we have many more escalatory steps that we could take.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, do you have specific agreements with countries, exporters to ensure Europe has a steady supply of gas?&nbsp; Or is that still a work in progress?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I certainly understand your question.&nbsp; As Daleep said, it&#8217;s a very &#8212; at a very sensitive time in the process right now.&nbsp; But what we&#8217;re doing right now is talking both to major natural gas producers to understand their capacity and willingness to surge nat- &#8212; natural gas output, which of course is a regional issue that would have an impact in Europe, and also talking, as he said, to a range of producers to &#8212; to help assess &#8212; or help reduce the market impact and the impact on the American public.&nbsp; But I just can&#8217;t outline any more details on it from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you talk about the American &#8212; the impact that you’re &#8212; on the American public, you mean, specifically, Americans should expect higher gasoline prices.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, energy prices.&nbsp; Exactly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s &#8212; that&#8217;s what we want the American public to be aware is a possibility.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And are you announcing more oligarchs tomorrow?&nbsp; Is that the plan?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don’t have anything to preview for you at this point in time.&nbsp; But I can certainly check if there’s another tranche coming tomorrow.&nbsp; Absolutely.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, given that the President stressed today that diplomacy is still available but now the Blinken-Lavrov meeting is off, you just said, this future summit between the President and Putin is not in the plans anymore &#8212; can you help paint a picture of what exactly diplomacy looks like in terms of dealing with Russia?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, we still &#8212; the door to diplomacy still remains open.&nbsp; And it just &#8212; as I think our foreign &#8212; our Secretary of State conveyed, it isn&#8217;t the appropriate time, as Russia is taking escalatory steps and preparing to invade, for him to meet with the foreign minister.</p>



<p>And it had always been the intention that any engagement with President Putin would be discussed there and potentially (inaudible) there.&nbsp; But there were never any specific plans or timeline, really, in the works for that.&nbsp; So, it was really going to be discussed at that meeting.</p>



<p>What diplomacy looks like: One, we&#8217;re going to continue to engage with our European partners, of course, and we will continue to remain open to &#8212; to having diplomatic conversations once &#8212; if and when they de-escalate.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diplomatic conversations &#8212; so, certainly between President Biden and President Putin in the future?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, of course, that remains an option.&nbsp; And as we’ve said, I think, over the course of the last few days, he&#8217;s always going to be open to having leader-to-leader conversations, but this isn&#8217;t the time to do it when &#8212; and we said this at the time as well &#8212; when they are &#8212; when President Putin is overseeing the invasion of a sovereign country.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just quickly, what is the U.S. assessment right now of Russian invasion into Kyiv?&nbsp; Is that considered an immediate danger right now?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It con- &#8212; it is considered &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to give you a timeline, but it&#8217;s considered a real possibility, yes.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For weeks, Jake Sullivan and other top officials have said that the administration and the White House has learned the lessons of 2014, and you will enact &#8212; in sanctions, you will enact “start high and stay high,” rather than gradually escalate.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you talk about the chunks and different trenches, it seems you are doing the opposite.&nbsp; Why is that the approach that you’re taking &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Not true, actually.&nbsp; We actually didn’t sanction these type of financial institutions back in 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; But just more of the broad &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; And it took several weeks to sanction these types of institutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But more in terms of the theory of the case &#8212; that instead of doing it in pieces, where you start and then continue to add on, the lessons that Jake and others have signaled was that you “start high and stay high,” instead of doing it more piecemeal.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, that’s exactly what we’re doing.&nbsp; So, the announcement that was made today about these financial institutions is more significant that was &#8212; than what was done in 2014.&nbsp; And we would only build further from here.&nbsp; So, that is starting high and staying high.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Russian actions would trigger the fullest extent of U.S. sanctions?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m just not going to detail what exact reaction will be to each action.&nbsp; Obviously, we have a range of options at our disposal.&nbsp; They&#8217;re &#8212; all remain on the table, and our preference is, of course, de-escalation, not instituting more sanctions.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the administration confident that sanctions and export controls can or will be enough to turn to deter Putin?</p>



<p>And can you go into any more detail about what those export controls might look like?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I can&#8217;t go into specific &#8212; more specifics.&nbsp; Just a range of options are on the table.&nbsp; And obviously, export control actions would have a significant additional impact on the economy there.</p>



<p>In terms of &#8212; tell me your first part of your question again?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, yeah.&nbsp; Just is the administration confident that sanctions and export controls can deter Putin?&nbsp; Are they enough?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, part of what sanctions are is &#8212; they’re intended to be a deterrent, but they&#8217;re also intended to have a squeezing, significant impact on the economy that is felt over a sustainable period of time that makes it more difficult to continue those behaviors and those actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They&#8217;re not &#8212; they&#8217;re not intended or designed to be an end when they&#8217;re initially announced.&nbsp; So that &#8212; those are the range of options we have at our disposal, and there will continue to be a growing impact.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; The President said last week that he was hoping to, maybe, work with Congress on some sort of proposal to address energy prices.&nbsp; Is that still on the table or is this focus now on sort of diplomacy with producers and consumers?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; All is on the table.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what might that look like?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Discussions with Congress?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Would it be in the form of legislation to lower prices?&nbsp; I mean, what kind of policies is &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That is an option, but I don&#8217;t have anything to detail for you at this point in time.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, on another subject, the U.S. and several countries are close to reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.&nbsp; What&#8217;s the likelihood of an agreement, you know, this week, in your view?&nbsp; And would the U.S. agree to a deal that does not include the release of U.S. and British prisoners held by Iran?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let me &#8212; let me start with your second question because this is a really important one.&nbsp; But the discussions on unjustly detained and innocent Americans remains separate from the JCPOA talks.&nbsp; Special Envoy Malley has reiterated, “…it&#8217;s very hard for us to imagine getting back into the nuclear deal” &#8212; or agreeing to kind of a new iteration of the deal, to the point of your question &#8212; “while four innocent Americans” &#8212; and others &#8212; “are being held hostage by Iran.”</p>



<p>It&#8217;s really a matter of urgency to bring the detainees home, and we want it to be resolved immediately.&nbsp; But it is happening from a &#8212; through a separate channel &#8212; those conversations.</p>



<p>In terms of the status of the JCPOA talks, we have made substantial progress &#8212; or substantial progress has been made over the last week or so, and is continuing to be made.&nbsp; Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.&nbsp; And so, until then, I&#8217;m not going to give you a rosy assessment.&nbsp; But it is, of course, good that substantial progress has been made.&nbsp; If Iran shows seriousness, we believe we can and should reach an understanding on mutual return to full implementation of the JCPOA.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just real quick, is the President concerned at all about the convoy of truckers that is making its way to Washington?&nbsp; And has he taken any sort of steps to protect the city?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes, we&#8217;ve actually been monitoring this closely.&nbsp; The Department of Homeland Security and the administration are tracking reports of a potential convoy that may be planning to travel to several U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have been working, including from Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall here, as well as our Homeland Security Department with &#8212; closely with our federal, state, and local partners to continuously assess the threat environment and keep our communities safe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And our efforts include enhanced intelligence sharing, a Critical Incident Response Plan for the U.S. Capitol, a regional security assessment, and a simulation experiment that developed data-driven recommendations to bolster regional security.</p>



<p>So, we are closely monitoring, closely watching, and working with state and local authorities.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; First, I just want to thank everybody &#8212; I know it’s late &#8212; who is &#8212; we’re limiting our questions so that more people can &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes, sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I appreciate that.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; And if anybody needs to go for a hit or anything, nobody will take it personally.&nbsp; I know some people have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, one question, of course, on Ukraine, first of all: Daleep said just now that today&#8217;s sanction package is, quote, “just the beginning of it.”&nbsp; Does that mean if nothing changes, you expect more sanctions?&nbsp; Or what does that mean “just the beginning of it”?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It means we have a range of additional options that we have the ability to take.&nbsp; And if President Putin continues to escalate, so will we.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then on &#8212; looking to the State of the Union, when was the last time President Biden spoke to a member of Congress about any item in the Build Back Better agenda?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He has a range of conversations all the time, but I&#8217;m not going to detail the timeline of those for you.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; When can we expect a more detailed explanation from the White House about how it would plan to bring down energy prices?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think, as Daleep just conveyed, a lot of what&#8217;s happening right now is sensitive.&nbsp; It includes conversations with foreign counterparts and other major large global suppliers.&nbsp; It also includes conversations we&#8217;re continuing to have with Congress and others about what steps may be at our disposal.&nbsp; And the President is continuing to consider options.&nbsp; So I expect we&#8217;ll have more to tell you when &#8212; if any decisions are made.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And given what we have heard publicly from the Russians in the last several days, what level of concern does the White House have that the conflict could spill over out of Ukraine and into some of the other nations that the U.S. has vowed to protect militarily and are part of NATO?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, without making any prediction of that, what I can tell you is that one of the steps we&#8217;ve taken, including an announcement that the Department of Defense made today about a plussing-up of an additional 800 personnel to the Baltic region from Italy, is that we take our commitments to our NATO Allies and partners seriously, and we are going to continue to take steps to plus up their support and ensure that they know that they have the backing of the United States.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m not going to make any other predictions of that.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks a lot.&nbsp; The NSC’s Brett McGurk&#8211;</p>



<p>(A noise interrupts the briefing.)</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That was a little scary.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NSC’s Brett McGurk and the State Department’s Amos Hochstein &#8212; I hope I didn’t butcher it too much.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;Hochstein.&nbsp; But it’s okay.&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hochstein.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I just wanted to ask: What concrete assurances were they able to secure on managing potential market pressures from Saudi Arabia?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I certainly understand the question.&nbsp; We did confirm that they went on a trip.&nbsp; And they discussed a range of issues, including Yemen, but also including steps to take to &#8212; steps we can all take to coordinate and reduce the impact on the global market on oil &#8212; of oil.&nbsp; But I can&#8217;t detail anything further from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If one of the objectives is not to disrupt global energy flows, and energy prices are high and rising, how can Russia&#8217;s bottom line really be hurt if you don&#8217;t disrupt global (inaudible) flows?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think Russia&#8217;s bottom line can be hurt in a lot of ways, including the range of sanctions we&#8217;ve already announced today and additional sets of sanctions that we have at our disposal should they choose, whether it&#8217;s sanctioning additional individuals or taking more significant steps that would real- &#8212; would impact their financial market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there&#8217;s no question we have a range of tools that could continue to have crippling impacts on the Russian economy.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But so much of their revenue comes from oil and energy.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I understand what you&#8217;re saying.&nbsp; But we also have a range of tools that could impact a range of their financial mar- &#8212; have huge financial market impacts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the President is also looking at and we&#8217;re all assessing what steps we can take that will have a crippling impact on them while reducing the impact on the American public.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just trying to get a better idea of what the administration deems to be an &#8220;escalation&#8221; on the part of Russia.&nbsp; And, two &#8212; and what would prompt an additional tranche of sanctions?&nbsp; Would it only be the expansion of Russian forces to non-occupied republics or areas of Ukraine, or would it be the continued deployment of forces to the two separatist regions that were detailed yesterday?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think as we&#8217;ve seen &#8212; as you have seen, hopefully &#8212; as Russia has taken any escalatory steps, we have taken escalatory steps on our end in the form of sanctions.&nbsp; And so, I&#8217;m not going to outline for you, “If this, then then.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I think if &#8212; for those of you, again, who watched the speech last night, the President &#8212; President Putin direct &#8212; attacked Ukraine&#8217;s right to exist.&nbsp; He explicitly threatened war unless his extreme demands were met.&nbsp; He gave an entire speech selling a war to the Russian people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our expectation &#8212; and we hope we are wrong &#8212; is that he will continue to take escalatory actions and further invade the country, and we will take additional steps in response.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the administration preparing any sort of measures for Ukrainians already in the United States, such as TPS or any other sort of immigration protections, for those who might not want to go back (inaudible)?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure, I don&#8217;t &#8212; obviously those decisions or assessments are made by the Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t make a prediction of that at this point in time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, what we are doing on the ground is trying to provide a range of economic, humanitarian, and security assistance to the Ukrainian government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I understand you&#8217;re asking about people who are here.&nbsp; And obviously we are preparing for the potential for major humanitarian outflows that could go into Europe and have a range of needs, and so that is also something we are closely tracking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are also pre- &#8212; poised to increase our support to the people of Ukraine should additional humanitarian needs arise.&nbsp; Our response would be based on assessment of the needs, our partners’ emergency appeals, in coordination with our European allies and partners.</p>



<p>But we are assessing the humanitarian assi- &#8212; situation on the ground very closely, and we&#8217;re going to continue engage with Allies and partners about any humanitarian needs that escalate and refugee outflows if they are to continue to occur.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given we&#8217;re getting close to the deadline, just &#8212; are SCOTUS interviews done at this point?&nbsp; I know it&#8217;s all in process and it&#8217;s &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I know.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, you know, are they done at this point?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The long national process will soon be over, Zolan.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the good news.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not going to detail the status.&nbsp; But I can tell you that the President has not made a decision yet, but we remain on track for him to make a decision and make an announcement before the end of the month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I know you said you didn&#8217;t like military questions too much.&nbsp; But &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No, I love military questions.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just not going to outline military movements from here.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Okay, fine.&nbsp; Because, you know, one &#8212; one kind of salient aspect to this whole thing has been actually openness of the U.S. in giving military details about what the Russians are up to, so I&#8217;m wondering if you can go a little further with that.</p>



<p>It seems important &#8212; that people don&#8217;t really understand, like, these &#8212; you know, the so-called peacekeepers, like, how many are there?&nbsp; Are they in Donbas now?&nbsp; Is it a handful of people?&nbsp; Is it a few guys with, like, you know, jeeps, or is it tons of tanks, missiles?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think Americans really have a good idea of what it is &#8212; what this invasion actually consists of right now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; And I appreciate &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So if you can say anything on that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And another question would be: There&#8217;s obviously no U.S. trainers in Ukraine anymore.&nbsp; Will this training &#8212; military training relationship continue in a third country?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; On the second, I would point to the Department of Defense, who&#8217;s best equipped to answer that question.</p>



<p>On the first: It&#8217;s a really important one.&nbsp; You know, I think it&#8217;s important for the American public, who may be just tuning in, to know that there has been a military &#8212; Russian military presence in Ukraine since back to 2014, which they never admitted, they never acknowledged.&nbsp; In some ways, they&#8217;ve only recently acknowledged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back in 2014 and in the years after, we called them &#8220;the little green men&#8221; because they were not in Russian military uniform.&nbsp; Now we know that they are all over eastern Ukraine.&nbsp; And they are &#8212; while not in uniform, they are behaving just like Russian military would be behaving.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So that is something &#8212; I can&#8217;t give you a number or specifics from here because I can&#8217;t get into intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it is important for the American people to know that &#8212; that regardless of whether they&#8217;re in uniform or not, they&#8217;ve been there since 2014.&nbsp; They are representing the Russian government.&nbsp; They are separatists who are &#8212; we probably should stop calling them &#8220;peacekeepers&#8221; because they are certainly not that &#8212; who are, you know, helping to lay the predicate for war.&nbsp; And that is what the purpose of a lot of them is there for.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, but did anything change in the last 24 hours?&nbsp; I think that&#8217;s &#8212; that&#8217;s really the question.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to be able to give you any additional assessment of that at this point in time from here.&nbsp; But I understand your question, and we&#8217;ll continue to work to give you more.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Two quick questions on Nord Stream 2.&nbsp; The first is: The deputy director just said that stopping Nord Stream 2 relieved Europe of a &#8220;geostrategic chokehold&#8221; that Russia would have had on them.&nbsp; So, if Nord Stream 2 going online was such a threat, why, in May, did the President waive sanctions on the company and the chief executive behind it?</p>



<p>And my second question is: Is there a concern that Nord Stream 2 &#8212; if Russia were to make concessions or retreat in some way, that that might open up the door to Nord Stream 2 going back online?&nbsp; Or is it your understanding that it is dead no matter what Russia does?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would first say that, you know, the President has never been a supporter of Nord Stream 2.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve always criticized it as a &#8212; as a project that we didn&#8217;t support.&nbsp; We took a range of steps and sanctions &#8212; including sanctions, to make that very clear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What &#8212; the announcement made by the German Chancellor today was not by accident; it was at the conclusion of a range of diplomatic engagements and efforts by the President and members of our national security team, in unity from the Europeans, about the fact that this could not move forward.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve never felt &#8212; the President didn&#8217;t feel that issuing pre-emptive sanctions on that was the right step to take.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But look where we are: Nord Stream 2 is not moving forward.&nbsp; And, by the way, it hasn&#8217;t been operational anyway.&nbsp; So, you know, that&#8217;s a fact; it&#8217;s not moving forward at this point in time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of the future, we&#8217;ve never felt it was a good project.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been clear about that.&nbsp; And that assessment I don&#8217;t expect would change in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Does the White House any &#8212; have any reaction to former President Trump calling Putin&#8217;s move yesterday &#8220;genius&#8221; and &#8220;smart&#8221;?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, as a matter of policy, we try not to take advice from anyone who praises President Putin and his military strategy, which I believe is what happened there; expresses an openness to lifting sanctions about the seizing of territory in Crimea; or, at any point in time, told leaders of the G7 that Crimea is a part of Russia, regardless if they are a former president.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there&#8217;s a bit of a different tactic, a bit of a different approach.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s probably why President Biden, and not his predecessor, was able to rally the world and the global community in taking steps against &#8212; against Russia&#8217;s aggression.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any fear that statements like that could turn support for Ukraine into a more partisan issue among the U.S. public?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; By the former president?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I &#8212; you know, I think that is up to members of the Republican Party to make the decision, to make the determination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It has &#8212; there is a long history, decades of history &#8212; which President Biden was a part of when he was Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee &#8212; of standing up to the efforts of any country to seize the territory of another country, standing up for efforts by the United States to rally global support against &#8212; against inappropriate and illegal actions by another country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a long history of that &#8212; not in a partisan way, in a bipartisan way &#8212; and certainly that choice is up to Republicans to make &#8212; to determine.</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve got two questions quickly.&nbsp; The administration rolled out a list of sanctions against Russian oligarchs and elites.&nbsp; My question is: Are any of them being sanctioned for the first time, or are these, sort of, repeat bad offenders?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s a good question.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure we can get you a breakdown of that.&nbsp; I believe some of them are new, and certainly the banks are new.&nbsp; But let us get you a more specific breakdown of that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then my second question is: The last time Jake Sullivan was here, he said that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would lead to U.S. sanctions, warning that that would necessarily make Moscow more beholden to Beijing.&nbsp; Obviously, both of those foreign powers aren&#8217;t exactly the most friendly to us.&nbsp; So, is the administration taking any steps or issuing any warnings to keep those geopolitical foes from, you know, aligning together and marching in lockstep?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, long before the events of the last few months, we saw China and Russia moving closer together in some capacity.&nbsp; But, right now, as we&#8217;re looking at the actions of President Putin and the &#8212; as we&#8217;re preparing for him to further invade Ukraine, to unfortunately put forward death and destruction on the country and the people of Ukraine, it&#8217;s really a question for China on whether they look at that and think that&#8217;s acceptable behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I think you saw that our Secretary of State had a conversation with his counterpart in the last 24, 48 hours.&nbsp; And we will certainly remain and continue to engage, but I think it&#8217;s about looking at where the global community is in this moment and determining where you want to stand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>La- &#8212; okay, go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; I wanted to ask about rapid COVID tests.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have an update at this point on how many you’ve shipped and how many you have under contract?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I believe we do, but I&#8217;m going to have to get that to you after the briefing.&nbsp; We have &#8212; let me get that to you after the briefing because I think we have some updated numbers on that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think we&#8217;re going to have to wrap up shortly here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask you one more?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead, in the back.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; I &#8212; I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; I had to step out &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s okay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; for a live shot for a moment.&nbsp; But &#8212; so if somebody asked this question, I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; But I would like to clarify what Daleep said at the beginning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI: Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said that Nord Stream 2 will go to waste now.&nbsp; So, do you have assurance from Germany that it&#8217;s &#8212; the decision to cancel the project is final, or it&#8217;s still reversible?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would really &#8212; I don&#8217;t have anything to build on beyond what &#8212; the strong statements and the strong comments of the Chancellor this morning and the President&#8217;s own statements about how it would not move forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Okay.&nbsp; Thanks, everyone.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll see you tomorrow.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Remote camera clicks repeatedly.)&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; There&#8217;s a ghost photographer in the walls.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; Where is Doug Mills?&nbsp; Is he back there?&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>
