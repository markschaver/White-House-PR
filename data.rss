<p class="has-text-align-center">South Court Auditorium<br>Eisenhower Executive Office Building</p>



<p>3:18 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MR. DEESE:&nbsp; Hey, Mr. President, it&#8217;s great to see you.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Hey.&nbsp; How you doing?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MR. DEESE:&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got members of your economic and energy team here.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re prepared to start the briefing, but we&#8217;ll start by turning the floor over to you, sir.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, thanks.&nbsp; Let me start by apologizing &#8212; my voice. &nbsp;I’m feeling much better than I sound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, we’re meeting today on gas prices, and we have some really good news: Gas prices are coming down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, gas prices have fallen every day this summer for 38 days in a row.&nbsp; Now, you know, you can &#8212; you can find gas for $3.99 or less in more than 30,000 gas stations in more than 35 states.&nbsp; In some cities, it’s down almost a dollar from last month.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been working really hard to bring the price down.</p>



<p>Four months ago, I gave an order to release 1 million barrels of oil per day &#8212; a day &#8212; for our nation &#8212; from our nation&#8217;s Strategic Petroleum Reserve.&nbsp; And I led the world to coordinate the largest release of oil reserves in history, including from other countries.&nbsp; In total, more than 240 million barrels to boost global supply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During that time, I&#8217;ve also been working to increase U.S. production.&nbsp; Today, we&#8217;re producing 12 million barrels per day, and we&#8217;re on track to hit near-record highs.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been working to make sure that when the price of oil comes down, the price at the pump comes down as well, and comes down in real time.&nbsp; The good news is that&#8217;s happening, but it&#8217;s not happening fast enough.&nbsp; We’ve made progress, but prices are still too high.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do &#8212; talk about today with all of you.&nbsp; We need to work on this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, we&#8217;re going to look at ways to increase oil production from the existing wells and permits that exist today.&nbsp; The industry has more approved permits for production on federal lands than they can possibly use.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a fact.&nbsp; Let me say it again: They have more than they can use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So my message to these companies is: Use the permits or lose them.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t say we can&#8217;t &#8212; you don&#8217;t have access.</p>



<p>Second, I&#8217;m telling the industry, “You&#8217;re making record profits due to Putin&#8217;s war in Ukraine.&nbsp; Use those profits to increase production and refining.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t use those profits to buy back your stocks and dividends.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, thirdly, we&#8217;ll talk about a global price cap on Russian oil &#8212; that I got our partners to agree to last month at the G7 &#8212; that will keep supply up and Putin&#8217;s revenues down.&nbsp; In the days and weeks ahead, I&#8217;m going to keep doing what I can to bring down the price of gas at the pump.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the real answer is to get to a clean energy economy as soon as possible; turn this into something positive.&nbsp; That means cleaner renewable energy, more affordable electric vehicles, and clean energy manufactured here in the United States.&nbsp; That&#8217;s how we&#8217;ll protect the climate and create jobs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am &#8212; well, I’ll have more to say about this in our discussions and more in the coming days.&nbsp; But look, I want to stop here and turn it over to you, Brian.&nbsp; And let&#8217;s get this briefing started.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks.</p>



<p>MR. DEESE:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we were hoping today to cover three broad areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first is market developments, both where we are and we thi- &#8212; we’re headed.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ll turn in a moment to Chair Rouse on that front.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second is developments in the industry and the work that your team has been doing, at your direction, to engage with the industry on refining, on hurricane preparedness, and other issues that Secretary Granholm will update and brief you on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the third, as you mentioned, is on international developments, where, on &#8212; on the back of your securing an agreement to explore the price cap coming out of the G7, Secretary Yellen is back from a multi-country trip across Asia, and she and Amos will give you an update on international developments as well.</p>



<p>So with your permission, sir, we’ll now turn it &#8212; I&#8217;ll turn it over to Chair Rouse to talk about market developments.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Cece, I’m anxious to hear you.</p>



<p>CHAIR ROUSE:&nbsp; Terrific.&nbsp; So, Mr. President, as you mentioned at the top, Americans are getting some very much badly needed breathing room at the pump.&nbsp; The national average retail gas price today fell to $4.41.&nbsp; That&#8217;s about 60 cents lower than its mid-June peak.</p>



<p>While this is a national average, it is affected by the traditionally higher prices in western states.&nbsp; What you see when you look under these data is that more than thir- &#8212; in more than 30,000 stations, they&#8217;re now selling gas for less than $4.00 a gallon.&nbsp; In fact, the most common gas station price in America today is $3.99 a gallon.</p>



<p>This kind of decline at this time of year is quite unique.&nbsp; This is the 38th day in a row of declining retail gas prices.&nbsp; In fact, the rate of decline is among the fastest in over a decade, a dramatic decline during the peak summer driving season.&nbsp; In other words, it has been a trend, not a daily blip.</p>



<p>The decline translates into concrete savings for American families.&nbsp; The typical two-driver family is saving more than $60 a month.&nbsp; Economy wide, that would mean Americans will spend about $6.5 billion less in a month over the coming month, and that would be real savings.</p>



<p>Looking forward, we expect gas prices to decline further.&nbsp; However, as you noted, they are still too high.&nbsp; Refiner margins remain roughly double what is typical for this time of year, though they have declined from their record highs.&nbsp; Retailer margins are very elevated and are around 50 cents above what is typical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What that means is we expect gas prices at the pump to continue to come down.&nbsp; If the historical relationship between oil and gas prices were to hold, these lower oil prices could translate into an additional 40-cent decline in gas prices if industry passes along cost savings to consumers.&nbsp; This would bring the national average retail price to around $4.00.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, energy markets remain highly volatile, and that&#8217;s especially true in the current environment with the additional disruption created by Putin&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine.</p>



<p>So oil prices could rise again.&nbsp; And it is very difficult to reliably predict where these prices will be over the longer term.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you, Brian.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MR. DEESE:&nbsp; Thank you, Cece.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to &#8212; I&#8217;m going to turn it over to Secretary Granholm, but before we do, we&#8217;re going to ask the press to leave.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, how do you feel?&nbsp; Are you feeling better?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; (Gives a thumbs up.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Senior Advisor to the President and White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director, and White House officials from the Domestic Policy Council and Office of Intergovernmental Affairs convened a meeting with state legislative leaders from New York, Delaware, California, and Illinois to discuss how states are leading the way in efforts to hold gun manufacturers accountable.</p>



<p>President Biden has repeatedly called on Congress to repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), a federal law that provides gun manufacturers and gun dealers with more protection from liability than tobacco companies and alcohol companies. This law denies many victims of gun violence their day in court, and establishes a barrier preventing the public from holding gunmakers accountable and demanding reforms to their marketing and sales practices.</p>



<p>As the President continues to call for repeal of PLCAA, the White House is also working with state and local officials to advance strategies to hold gun manufacturers and dealers accountable for unlawful conduct. Last year, the White House convened a meeting with state Attorneys General to discuss&nbsp;the opportunity and barriers to using generally applicable state consumer protection and nuisance laws to take action against gun manufacturers and gun dealers.</p>



<p>Today, the White House convened state legislators to discuss how states are enacting state firearm-specific liability laws to create new predicates allowing litigation to proceed under PLCAA. New York, Delaware, and California are three examples of states that have enacted such liability laws. Many other states are working to join in this effort. For example, Illinois already has many gun safety laws in place – but in the wake of the horrific mass shooting in Highland Park on July 4, 2022, legislative leaders are considering additional measures to combat gun violence, including gun industry accountability measures.</p>



<p>State legislative leaders from today’s meeting included:</p>



<ul><li>New York State Senator Zellnor Myrie</li><li>Delaware State Senator Elizabeth Lockman</li><li>California State Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan</li><li>California Assemblymember Phil Ting</li><li>Illinois State Representative Bob Morgan</li><li>Illinois State Senate Assistant Majority Leader Chair Jacqueline Collins</li><li>Illinois State Representative Margaret Croke</li><li>Illinois State Representative Kambium Buckner</li><li>Illinois State Representative Maura Hirschauer</li><li>Illinois State Representative Denyse Stoneback</li></ul>

I am especially grateful for the courage of those who immediately intervened, and that he is unharmed and was able to continue his speech.

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During Made in America Week, we celebrate American workers, the products they make, the services they provide, and the incredible impact they have on our Nation&#8217;s economy. &nbsp;Across the world, &#8220;Made in America&#8221; is a badge of quality, and this week we honor the proud legacy and promising future of American goods, services, jobs, and innovation &#8212; the collective engine of American prosperity.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The COVID-19 pandemic and the economic crisis it caused, as well as Vladimir Putin&#8217;s unjustified and unprovoked war on Ukraine, have underscored the importance of a strong and secure domestic industrial base.&nbsp; We have seen in recent years that when goods made overseas become unavailable or exorbitantly costly, American families feel the pain.&nbsp; For years, &#8220;Buy American&#8221; was&nbsp;a hollow slogan &#8212; too many goods and services paid for by American taxpayers were outsourced abroad at the expense of American jobs. &nbsp;In my Administration, &#8220;Buy American&#8221; is an ironclad promise &#8212; and we have taken bold action to make it real.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During my first year in office, we created more manufacturing jobs on average per month than any other President has in&nbsp;the last 50 years. &nbsp;Businesses are investing in American manufacturing and creating thousands of good-paying union jobs to meet the demands of our modern economy and rebuild that economy around working people.&nbsp; We are creating more opportunity for workers and businesses who have too often been overlooked by investing in racial, gender, and geographic diversity for industries across the country.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Federal Government is the largest buyer of consumer goods in the world.&nbsp; To ensure that we are investing in American products, I recently announced a procurement rule that strengthens Buy American provisions by increasing the Made in America content threshold from 55 percent to 75 percent so that goods have to be truly made in America to be considered &#8220;Made in America.&#8221; &nbsp;This represents the biggest change to the Buy American Act in almost 70 years.&nbsp; I also named our Nation&#8217;s first-ever Made in America Director to serve in a high-level White House role.&nbsp; I continue to call on the Congress to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act so that we can create more resilient domestic supply chains and unleash the next generation of American innovation for the industries and jobs of the future.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is critical to advancing our Made in America agenda. &nbsp;We are rebuilding our Nation&#8217;s roads, bridges, ports, airports, and so much more.&nbsp; We&nbsp;are constructing a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle chargers installed by union workers on highways and in communities across America.&nbsp; We are ensuring that every American has clean drinking water.&nbsp; We are creating good-paying union jobs, revitalizing American manufacturing, and positioning the United States to continue to lead throughout the 21st century.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, we are leveraging a federally funded national network &#8212; the Manufacturing Extension Partnership &#8212; to help Government agencies connect with new suppliers across the country, including Black, Brown, and Native American-owned small businesses, which have often been excluded from these opportunities.&nbsp; My Administration also launched MadeInAmerica.gov to help American businesses in every community identify available government contracts, and we created a Made in America Council to help ensure that our future is made in all of America by all of America&#8217;s workers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A vibrant domestic industrial base is key to building an economy that works for working people and advancing America&#8217;s global leadership with American manufacturers and workers at the&nbsp;forefront. &nbsp;During Made in America Week, let us celebrate everything that is Made in America and the workers, businesses, and innovators who are the driving force behind their success.&nbsp; America is the most innovative country in the world, and together, we will build a competitive economy for the future right here at home.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 24 through July 30, 2022, as Made in America Week.&nbsp; I call upon all Americans to observe this week by supporting American workers and domestic businesses that are the backbone of building a future here in America and celebrating Made in America.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day of July, in the year of our Lord two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;twenty-second, and of the Independence of the United&nbsp;States of&nbsp;America the two&nbsp;hundred and forty-seventh.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>

<p>Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)</p>



<p>Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the <em>Federal Register</em> and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date.&nbsp; In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the <em>Federal Register </em>for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to the situation in Mali declared in Executive Order 13882 of July 26, 2019, is&nbsp;to&nbsp;continue in effect beyond July 26, 2022.</p>



<p>The situation in Mali, including repeated violations of ceasefire arrangements made pursuant to the 2015 Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali; the expansion of terrorist activities into southern and central Mali; the intensification of drug trafficking and trafficking in persons, human rights abuses, and hostage-taking; a further coup d&#8217;etat; the presence of foreign mercenaries threatening peace, security, and stability; and the intensification of attacks against civilians, the Malian defense and security forces, the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), and international security presences, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.&nbsp; Therefore, I&nbsp;have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13882 with respect to the situation in Mali<em>.</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sincerely,</p>

<p>On July 19, 2022, National Cyber Director Chris Inglis hosted the National Cyber Workforce and Education Summit at the White House. The event focused on building our Nation’s cyber workforce, improving skills-based pathways to cyber jobs, educating Americans so that they have the skills they need to thrive in our increasingly digital society, and improving Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) in the cyber field. Bringing together entities who employ, train, and educate cyber professionals and Americans at large, the event involved senior U.S. Government officials, senior executives from the private sector, and thought leaders from across the cyber community and the education sector.</p>



<p>Participants included Ambassador Susan E. Rice, White House Domestic Policy Advisor; Secretary of Commerce Gina M. Raimondo; Secretary of Labor Martin J. Walsh; Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas; and Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal. Other U.S. Government participants included Jen Easterly, Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency; Laurie Locascio, Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology; Anne Neuberger, Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology on the National Security Council; George Barnes, Deputy Director of the National Security Agency; and Principal Deputy National Cyber Director Kemba Walden. The Biden-Harris Administration and the various stakeholders in this area are committed to meeting the challenges and opportunities relating to cyber workforce and education, which will help improve the economy, secure Americans and our Nation’s infrastructure, advance our digital way of life, and enable our society to maximize cyber capabilities to achieve our highest aspirations.</p>



<p>The Summit included three roundtable discussions: the “All” roundtable focused on ways to help ensure that all Americans are equipped with the skills and knowledge to effectively and safely engage in our global digital ecosystem; the “Many” roundtable explored ways to improve practices in cyber-adjacent fields that are not focused solely on cyber but are still impacted by it, are related to it, or benefit from it; and the “Few” roundtable discussed the jobs and career pathways that are specifically focused on cyber.</p>



<p>In connection with the Summit, the Biden-Harris Administration announced the following actions:</p>



<ul><li><strong>National Cyber Director Chris Inglis</strong> committed to developing a National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy in coordination with other elements of the Executive Office of the President (EOP) as well as Federal departments and agencies, with input from key public and private stakeholders. The National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy will aim to address the challenges and opportunities in these critical areas, improve collaboration across government-wide efforts, help align resources to aspirations, and implement Biden-Harris Administration priorities on education and workforce development.</li><li><strong>Secretary of Commerce Gina M. Raimondo and Secretary of Labor Martin J. Walsh </strong><a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osec/osec20220719">announced</a> a 120-day Cybersecurity Apprenticeship Sprint that they are leading with support from other Federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Education, the Office of Personnel Management, and others. This initiative is aimed at providing individuals with the opportunity to receive the training and mentorship they need to begin a career in the cyber workforce by expanding and promoting cyber-related Registered Apprenticeship programs. More information on this program can be found at <a href="https://www.apprenticeship.gov/cybersecurity-apprenticeship-sprint">https://www.apprenticeship.gov/cybersecurity-apprenticeship-sprint</a>.</li><li><strong>Ambassador Susan E. Rice </strong>announced efforts to strengthen the K-12 system to more effectively prepare students for job opportunities in cybersecurity.Specifically, 1) the National Security Agency is supporting an initiative by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education that will provide technical assistance to state and local educational agencies to accelerate the development, adoption, and implementation of middle grades CTE programs focused on emerging career pathways, such as space and cybersecurity; and 2) the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education will make its Cybersecurity Workforce Framework—which provides a range of cyber curricula and resources—easier to use for K-12 teachers and leaders by creating a K12 Educator FAQ resource.</li></ul>



<p>In addition, the following organizations have made substantial announcements, commitments, or pledges in connection with the Summit:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Accenture</strong> is committed to creating access to new roles in cybersecurity, cloud, and other technical areas through its apprenticeship and upskilling programs. This is part of Accenture’s broader goal in the U.S. to fill 20% of entry-level roles from its apprenticeship program. Additionally, Accenture is committed to training all 700,000+ of its own people through its award-winning interactive security awareness courses next year.</li><li><strong>The</strong> <strong>Alperovitch Institute for Cybersecurity Studies</strong>, aimed at developing a unique mix of geopolitical focus and technical rigor with cutting edge research at the intersection of cybersecurity and statecraft, has been established to train postgraduate students to become future policymakers and practitioners for leading firms and government agencies in the field of cybersecurity. The Alperovitch Institute will also offer an executive education program to provide critical understanding of cyber issues to industry executives, boards of directors, Congressional staffers, government officials, and military and intelligence officers, with classes to begin this fall.</li><li><strong>Auburn University’s</strong> Ginn College of Engineering commits to incorporate the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Cyber-Informed Engineering (CIE) Strategy throughout its engineering and computer science programs. As a land grant institution with roots in outreach and extension to its citizenry, Auburn also announced an initiative to partner with cooperative extension offices across the state to better reach underserved communities.</li><li><strong>Cisco </strong>is committing to training an additional 200,000 students in the U.S. over the next three years and will continue to increase the reach and impact of its efforts. For nearly 25 years, Cisco Networking Academy has trained more than two million U.S. students with leading networking and cybersecurity skills, and currently partners with 49% of the nation’s community and technical colleges and 48 of the nation’s 107 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).</li><li><strong>CompTIA</strong>, in partnership with ConnectWise,will run a nationwide pilot program to fill critical cybersecurity roles for managed services providers.CompTIA, as a National Program Sponsor for Apprenticeship, will use its training and certifications to provide jobseekers the skills needed for a career in IT and help employers realize the benefits of IT apprenticeship.</li><li><strong>The Council on Competitiveness</strong> National Commission on Innovation and Competitiveness Frontiers is launching two new working groups this fall: “The Future of Work: Developing, Supporting, and Expanding the Modern Innovation Workforce” and “The Future of Technology: Developing and Deploying Disruptive Technologies at Scale.” Both working groups will address how to advance and optimize cyber infrastructures of the future, including the robust cyber security and resiliency on which these digital platforms depend.</li><li><strong>The Cyber Readiness Institute (CRI) </strong>has released a new guide to raise awareness and implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA) among small and medium-sized businesses (SMB). The new MFA guide provides clear and actionable information SMBs can implement today to enhance their cybersecurity. Developed with input from CRI’s Small Business Advisory Council and subject matter experts at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the guide employs an FAQ format to address concerns SMBs have expressed about using MFA.</li><li><strong>Dakota State University </strong>highlighted their $90 million investment for a cyber-research initiative supported by a multi-party, public-private partnership. These funds will be used to double the annual number of graduates of The Beacom College of Computer and Cyber Sciences over the next 5 years, launch a statewide Governor’s Cyber Academy accessible to all high school students, and build and operate an applied research laboratory facility in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.</li><li><strong>Fortinet </strong>is furthering its commitment to close the cyber skills gap by making its information security awareness and training service available for free for all K-12 school districts across the U.S. The expansion of its free training offerings provides the potential to help more than 8 million staff and faculty members in U.S. schools become more cyber aware and improve their skillsets to avoid breaches at educational institutions. This initiative will also advance Fortinet’s pledge to train 1 million people in cybersecurity by 2026.</li><li><strong>Girls Who Code </strong>will develop a coding challenge and activity sets focused on cybersecurity that will be geared toward middle and high school students, and implement workshops for Computer Science Education Week focused on cybersecurity and introductions to cryptography this fall.</li><li><strong>IBM</strong> is creating more pathways to cybersecurity careers through its new Cybersecurity Leadership Centers with Historically Black Colleges &amp; Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) and is partnering with the American Council on Education (ACE) to translate cybersecurity apprenticeships into college credits. This builds on IBM’s commitment last year to train more than 150,000 people in cybersecurity skills over three years through its signature programs – IBM SkillsBuild, IBM Security Academy, and its collaboration with Coursera.</li><li><strong>(ISC)²</strong>—the world’s largest nonprofit association of certified cybersecurity professionals—announced the (ISC)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;One Million Certified in Cybersecurity<sup>SM</sup>&nbsp;program, pledging to put one million people through its Certified in Cybersecurity entry-level certification exam and education program for free. (ISC)² also has committed that half of this investment – 500,000 course enrollments and exams – will be directed toward students of HBCUs, minority-serving institutions (MSIs), tribal organizations and women’s organizations across the U.S. and the globe.</li><li><strong>The Linux Foundation (LF) </strong>is offering for free the Developing Secure Software training program, which is 15 hours of training across 3 modules (security principles; implementation considerations and software verification; and cloud security). The goal is to teach software developers how to develop more secure software from the beginning because that is much more efficient than finding and remediating vulnerabilities. Since launching it this spring, over 10,000 students have started the course and over 1,000 completed it and received their verifiable certification. Over the next few months, LF will launch new courses and certification exams on topics such as Sigstore, SBOMs and Air Gap Software Delivery.</li><li><strong>NightDragon</strong>, along with several industry partners, is creating the Cyber Talent Hub (CTH) because the Nation must leverage technology to better align the economic incentives of stakeholders involved in addressing the cyber talent shortage. The CTH will take the best attributes and practices from other technology driven marketplaces, helping employers find qualified candidates from diverse backgrounds and subsidize their cybersecurity education and training, which is tailored to the specific positions sought by these students.</li><li><strong>NPower </strong>will offer skill development opportunities and free IT training and credentials to military-connected individuals as well as young adults from underserved and underrepresented communities. NPower will increase the number of students in its Tech Fundamentals certification training by 50% within three years, thereby increasing its pipeline for advanced credentials in cloud computing and cybersecurity.
