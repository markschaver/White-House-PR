<p class="has-text-align-center">Rayburn Room<br>U.S. Capitol</p>



<p>12:43 P.M. EDT</p>



<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you very much, Nancy.&nbsp; That was very kind.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>Father, before I begin &#8212; bless me, Father, for I’m about to sin.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I &#8212; well, I just want you to know, I may be Irish, but I&#8217;m not stupid.&nbsp; I married Dominic Giacoppa’s daughter.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Okay?&nbsp; (Inaudible.)</p>



<p>Look, thank you very much, Nancy, for that very gracious and very over-the-top introduction.&nbsp; I appreciate it very much.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, I just got off the &#8212; on the way up, before I came up here, I was on the Zoom, as we say, with the Taoiseach for about 45 minutes.&nbsp; And he is &#8212; he&#8217;s looking well, he feels well.&nbsp; He&#8217;s tested positive, but he feels well.&nbsp; He looks good.&nbsp; And he wanted to &#8212; I know the Ambassador is here to bring his regards, but he is &#8212; he&#8217;s really sorry he can&#8217;t be here, and he was looking forward to it, as was his wife.</p>



<p>You know, the good spirits and feelings, as well, that exist on St. Patrick&#8217;s Day seems to be one of those few times and not &#8212; well, not &#8212; I shouldn’t say “a few” &#8212; we should have more times like this where Democrats and Republicans get together, and we actually not only agree on one thing, but we remind ourselves we actually like each other.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; And it&#8217;s a useful thing.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And, I &#8212;</p>



<p>You know, Yeats wrote, and I quote, “Talent perceives differences; genius, unity.”&nbsp; “Talents perceives differences; genius, unity.”&nbsp; And, you know, I think today we can add a fifth item to at least my Unity Agenda, and that&#8217;s support of our relationship between Ireland and the United States, which has taken on an even more intense and cooperative form than it ever has, because of Ireland&#8217;s neutrality.</p>



<p>On this issue, it brings together Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, Richie Neal &#8212; who is Irish, as we say where I come from, from the belt buckle to shoe sole &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; and &#8212; and the leaders of both our parties, and all the Friends of Ireland.</p>



<p>I &#8212; you know, I&#8217;m the proud son of Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden.&nbsp; And like so many Americans of Irish heritage, I love Ireland and I was raised in a circumstance where you would have thought my whole family &#8212; none of &#8212; they came in 1844 and 1845, but you’d think they’d all lived in Ireland the last 60 years &#8212; the previous 60 years.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The &#8212; there&#8217;s &#8212; as I was talking to Taoiseach today, the Irish on St. Patrick&#8217;s Day think that &#8212; Irish Americans think they&#8217;re more Irish than the Irish.&nbsp; And &#8212; but that&#8217;s kind of how I was raised, like so many Americans of Irish heritage &#8212; like other people of other heritage as well.</p>



<p>I was &#8212; it was imbued in me to be proud of &#8212; proud of my heritage.&nbsp; And, you know, the pride that was* passed down to generations of our family, even though they&#8217;ve been here since the mid-1800s.&nbsp; And it was just part of the air we breathed, especially up in Scranton and &#8212; where we lived with my &#8212; near my grandpop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My grandfather, Ambrose Finnegan, used to say &#8212; and I mean this &#8212; he’d say, “Joey, if you’re lucky enough to be Irish, you&#8217;re lucky enough.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Every time something bad happened, I’d go, “I don’t &#8212; I’m not sure.”&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; Anyway.</p>



<p>But because of being an Irish family, family was everything.&nbsp; My dad&#8217;s expression was, “Family is the beginning, the middle, and the end.”&nbsp; And &#8212; and he meant it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And &#8212; but, you know, the faith we share with one another and the resilience that we&#8217;ve all gone through, both in America and in Ireland, you know, are ones that we&#8217;ve been knocked down sometimes.&nbsp; Just knocked flat on our back.</p>



<p>And my &#8212; my mom&#8217;s expression, for real, was, “Joey, get up.&nbsp; Just get up.&nbsp; Get up.”&nbsp; It’s a simple proposition.&nbsp; It was sort of the Irish of it.&nbsp; You just get up, no matter what.&nbsp; Dust yourself off and move.&nbsp; Not &#8212; we&#8217;re not the only culture that has that view, but it was imbued in my family.</p>



<p>And the other one was that &#8212; and I mean this sincerely &#8212; my dad’s: “No one is better than you, and you&#8217;re no better than anyone else.”&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; “No one is better than you, but you’re no better than anyone else.”&nbsp; And it&#8217;s real.&nbsp; It&#8217;s real.&nbsp; Because we were taught never &#8212; as my mother would say, “Never bow, never bend, never yield.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the truth of the matter was that in the days when my parents and grandparents were growing up in the coal country of Scranton, being Irish was less than a badge of honor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My &#8212; my great grandfather Blewitt, my &#8212; on &#8212; my grandmother Finnegan’s maiden name &#8212; was only the second Catholic ever elected to the Senate in the state of &#8212; in the state of Pennsylvania.&nbsp; And that was 1907, and only the second one.&nbsp; The first one was in, I think, 1838 or 1840.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The point was that, like many cultures, like many folks, where you came from was either viewed as an asset or a liability.&nbsp; And where &#8212; you know, but the point is that everything that we were taught &#8212; and I&#8217;m sure all of you of Irish background, and other backgrounds as well, were taught that &#8212; that, you know, it&#8217;s all about striving for a better future; that you can do better &#8212; just simply do better. &nbsp;And, you know &#8212; and you can do it while you cherish the past. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, you don’t have to forget the past, or dis- &#8212; or disso- &#8212; disassociate yourself &#8212; yourself from it, but cherish it.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, these are the values of immigrants not only from Ireland, but from &#8212; like my great-great-grandparents when they were brought here &#8212; brought themselves to the United States.&nbsp; But today, it&#8217;s only part of what it means to be Irish.&nbsp; There is an indelible part of it that is American, because the values are the same, in my view &#8212; the values built into our Constitution that we are the &#8212;</p>



<p>I &#8212; I &#8212; you heard me say last night: I think we&#8217;re the most unique country in the history of the world.&nbsp; We&#8217;re the only country based upon &#8212; organizationally &#8212; not geography, not ethnicity, not &#8212; not race, not religion, but on a notion, an idea that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator, with certain inalienable rights: life, liberty.</p>



<p>I mean, that&#8217;s the basis of why we formed this country.&nbsp; No other country has ever been based on a notion like that.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve incorporated those notions, but the basis for their organization has been their ethnicity, their religion, their geography &#8212; whatever &#8212; but not here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I know I say it, and many of you say &#8212; and I think people wonder whether we really mean it: I really think the source of our strength is our diversity.&nbsp; The source of our strength is our diversity.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, you know, there are values that immigrants from Ireland brought and &#8212; but they’re &#8212; as I said, they&#8217;re not only &#8212; they&#8217;re not only Irish values, they&#8217;re values, I think, of the vast majority of immigrants who come to the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I&#8217;m proud to say that the bond between Ireland and the United States, by the way, has grown deeper and stronger over the years.&nbsp; For real.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve navigated a once-in-a-century pandemic together.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve grieved the loss of too many people in both our countries.&nbsp; And we worked to rebuild our economies and taken on the challenge of renewing and strengthening our democracy, because &#8212; again, I apologize for repeating myself, but I know many of you’ve heard me say I think we&#8217;re at an inflection point in history.&nbsp; I think &#8212; and I mean that sincerely.&nbsp; And it occurs every several generations.&nbsp; I think we&#8217;re in a genuine struggle between autocracies and democracies, and whether or not democracies can be sustained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I &#8212; I&#8217;m going to be speaking to President Xi tomorrow.&nbsp; And he&#8217;ll remind me that I told him &#8212; he remembers every damn thing I&#8217;ve said, unfortunately.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But all kidding aside, we talk about the idea he &#8212; that he does not believe demo- &#8212; democracies can be sustained in the 21st century because things move so rapidly, technology is changing so much, democracies don&#8217;t have time to arrive at consensus.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why autocracies will succeed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, you know, and now &#8212; you know, we &#8212; you have Ireland stepping up not only in terms of the relationship with us but, you know, the Good Friday Agreement is built on political and economic progress that we&#8217;ve made together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I know some criticize me, but I&#8217;ve &#8212; I&#8217;ve be- &#8212; I have a good relationship with the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Boris.&nbsp; We always kid each other when we see each other.&nbsp; But the point is that I&#8217;ve made it clear that &#8212; I don&#8217;t think I just speak for myself &#8212; the Good Friday Agreements are firmly, firmly, firmly, firmly supported here in the United States.&nbsp; And we insist that it occur, they be maintained because it’s (inaudible) too hard.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>The people of Northern Ireland have made significant changes as well.&nbsp; There&#8217;s movement, as you&#8217;ve mentioned &#8212; the young kids you talked about &#8212; Protestant and Catholic &#8212; talking to how &#8212; I mean, how they&#8217;ve never known anything but being able to get along.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I remember the first time I &#8212; on my parents’ 50th wedding anniversary, my brothers and sister, we got together and gave my &#8212; and we can work something out for you, Father &#8212; we gave my parents a &#8212; a trip to Ireland.&nbsp; And &#8212; but it coincided &#8212; I was going over to the Stormont talks.&nbsp; And so they said, “You take them, Joey.”&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And &#8212; but the point is that it was &#8212; it was an &#8212; a bit of an epiphany for my parents.&nbsp; They thought &#8212; you hear all the stories from your ancestors about this, that, and the other thing &#8212; some of it apocryphal, some of it real.&nbsp; But it was &#8212; it was really amazing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when we took them to the north, it was interesting.&nbsp; We went up to the Stormont and &#8212; anyway, they &#8212; it was an interesting thing to watch &#8212; to watch the look on my mother&#8217;s face and my father&#8217;s face as we toured Ireland, to see both the things that they had heard that were consistent with what they heard, because you never know whether they &#8212; you know, there&#8217;s exaggeration about, “Well, when &#8212; when this happened and that happened.”&nbsp; But they came back more hopeful than they had ever been as opposed to &#8212; and that was a while ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But my generic point is that, you know, now you have Ireland and Great Britain, and, you know, the Republic standing together against a murderous dictator, a pure thug, who is waging an immoral war against the people of Ukraine.</p>



<p>And, by the way, the Republic is paying a big price for this, a big number for supporting the strategy &#8212; for supporting the sanctions, including aircr- &#8212; a whole range of things.&nbsp; This &#8212; it’s not a minor contribution they’re making in this effort.&nbsp; It’s significant.</p>



<p>Ireland and the United States are working together.&nbsp; For the first time now, they&#8217;re on the United Nations Security Council.&nbsp; Ireland is a part of the Security Council now and the European Union.&nbsp; And Putin is paying a big price for his aggression.&nbsp; And &#8212; and they are part of the reason this cost is going so high.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s a little &#8212; you know, everybody talks about Germany having stepped up and changed the notions about being more &#8212; more leaning forward.&nbsp; But &#8212; and they have.&nbsp; Well, so is Ireland.&nbsp; So is Ireland &#8212; a neutral country.&nbsp; Ireland has stepped up and taking a hit for what they&#8217;re doing.</p>



<p>And you &#8212; look, you know, ladies and gentlemen, the relationship between Ireland and the United States is a dynamic and, I think, essential partnership that &#8212; as much as it&#8217;s ever been.&nbsp; And, you know, it&#8217;s sustained and strengthened by the Friends of Ireland, in this room and all across the country.&nbsp; And, you know, the connections that link our people stretch back through history, and they forward &#8212; well forward, I believe, in the future.</p>



<p>You know, we &#8212; we share a common goal: a future of a greater peace, greater hope, greater security, and a greater sense of who we are as countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, I &#8212; my &#8212; my mother&#8217;s expression, gotten from her grandfather, was, you know: As long as you&#8217;re alive, you have an obligation to strive.&nbsp; And you&#8217;re not dead until you’ve seen the face of God.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what I think of when I think of Ireland.&nbsp; All the troubles they&#8217;ve been through, they have never, ever, ever quit.&nbsp; Never, ever, ever, ever quit &#8212; not once.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve gotten up.&nbsp; And now they&#8217;re beginning to at least have the benefits of all the hard work and labor they&#8217;ve engaged in, and they’re becoming a real actor, Mr. Ambassador, on the world stage and at the United Nations.</p>



<p>And so, I want to thank you, Mr. Ambassador, and I thank the Taoiseach today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I &#8212; I just &#8212; I should &#8212; I should probably tell you that my mother, when I took &#8212; when we went to Ireland, and we were &#8212; we were in the south, and my father was a real gentleman.&nbsp; And his greatest regret was he never had a college education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if I were &#8212; if you or any one of you were coming back to Delaware with me and my dad were around or retired, and I didn&#8217;t call him to tell him I was bringing you over to introduce him so he had a chance to put on a coat and a tie &#8212; because he would only see you that way &#8212; that was my dad.</p>



<p>And as we were going to Ireland &#8212; FitzGerald was the Taoiseach &#8212; and we walked in to have a picture taken.&nbsp; And my dad had his brand-new blazer that had a &#8212; a patch on of&nbsp;my brother-in-law, Jack Owens &#8212; who&#8217;s Irish from &#8212; like you, Neal.&nbsp; And it was this patch &#8212; this crest.&nbsp; And it had Latin written on it.&nbsp; And I never took the time to look at it, although I had to take four years of Latin &#8212; three years of Latin in the Catholic high school I went to.</p>



<p>And Taoiseach &#8212; we’re having our picture taken, and he said, “Oh, Mr. Biden” &#8212; he said, “I agree.”&nbsp; And what it said in Latin was, “Don&#8217;t let the bastards get you down.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, we can&#8217;t let them get us down.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t let them get us down.</p>



<p>Thank you for allowing me to come back home, come up here and speak.&nbsp; And thank you, Nancy, for the nice compliments.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>SPEAKER PELOSI:&nbsp; As the President has to make a clean exit to go back to work, I wanted all of us to lift our glass to toast the President on this St. Patrick&#8217;s Day.</p>



<p>Mr. President, this is a toast that I learned from my grandchildren; I&#8217;ve said it to our colleagues here before.&nbsp; And it goes like this.&nbsp; It&#8217;s an Irish toast:&nbsp; Sing as is if no one can hear you.&nbsp; Dance as if no one can see you.&nbsp; Love as if you&#8217;ve loved &#8212; never loved before.&nbsp; And live as if heaven is on Earth.</p>



<p>So when I said to them, “Is that a toast that is a tradition in the Kenneally family?” they say, “No, that&#8217;s a sign that is in the Shannon Airport.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>To the President.&nbsp; Happy &#8212;</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SPEAKER PELOSI:&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President.&nbsp; Happy St. Patrick’s Day.</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, my grandmother had one.&nbsp; She said, “May those who love us, love us.&nbsp; And those who don&#8217;t, may they turn their ankle so we know they&#8217;re coming by their limp.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met virtually today with Taoiseach Micheál Martin of Ireland, upholding a longstanding White House tradition on St. Patrick’s Day that symbolizes the deep ties and historic partnership between our countries. The President expressed regret that he and the Taoiseach were unable to meet in person and wished him a speedy recovery. The leaders discussed the coordinated international response to Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war in Ukraine, including the imposition of significant economic costs on Russia and the provision of humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine who are displaced by the conflict. They welcomed the growing trade and investment ties between our countries, as well as our close cooperation on shared global challenges, including through the United Nations Security Council. &nbsp;The leaders also underscored their enduring commitment to the Good Friday Agreement (also known as the Belfast Agreement) and the importance of preserving political and economic stability in Northern Ireland.</p>



<p>After the bilateral meeting, the President attended the traditional St. Patrick’s Day Speaker’s Lunch on Capitol Hill, hosted by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. In the evening, the President and the First Lady will host at the White House the presentation of the shamrocks, a gesture of friendship and goodwill between the United States and Ireland that dates back to 1952.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>11:22 A.M. EDT</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Well, Taoiseach, I&#8217;m really deeply sorry you &#8212; for the inconvenience that we’re having to meet virtually again this year, although I did, at a little distance, for seven and a half minutes get to see you yesterday, but &#8212; and your beautiful wife.&nbsp; But &#8212; and especially after your flying all the way here to Washington and with a lot going on up in the Hill and the rest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But just as we did last year, the tradition of this beautiful bowl, the tradition of these beautiful shamrocks I have here with me.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And we&#8217;re meeting in a moment when demands on unity in the world are really accelerating.&nbsp; And we have to be united, and we certainly are.&nbsp; And &#8212; but I &#8212; Putin&#8217;s brutality and what he&#8217;s doing and his troops are doing in Ukraine is just inhumane.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, you know &#8212; as you know, your predecessor and you occasionally kid me about always quoting Irish poets.&nbsp; But &#8212; but Yeats had a great line in “Easter Sunday, 1919” [sic].&nbsp; He said, “All has changed, changed utterly: A terrible beauty has been born.”&nbsp; He was talking about his Ireland and what was going to come, which had turned out to be better than &#8212; than worse.<br>&nbsp;<br>But all has changed.&nbsp; I think that your leadership on the global stage has really been noticeable and impressive.&nbsp; You&#8217;re now a member of &#8212; temporarily for the &#8212; as you are a member of the Security Council.&nbsp; Your leadership on the global stage within the EU as well. &nbsp;And &#8212; and your condemnation of Putin&#8217;s aggression and support of the &#8212; of the sanctions.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s costing Ireland.&nbsp; It’s costing Ireland.&nbsp; But as usual, you&#8217;re basing it on principle and moral standing of the country.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And &#8212; but I also want to emphasize this administration&#8217;s unequivocal support for the Good Friday accords &#8212; for the Good Friday Agreement.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve made that clear, as you probably heard, to the Prime Minister and others: I think it&#8217;s &#8212; too much blood, sweat, and tears have been shed to get that done.&nbsp; And this is no time to change it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And we have a full agenda to discuss, I know.&nbsp; And &#8212; but deepening our cooperation &#8212; Ireland and the United States &#8212; bilaterally and through the European Union is &#8212; is &#8212; and taking on climate change, looking at economic opportunities we both have, and combating COVID combined is something that we&#8217;re going to work closely together on.<br>&nbsp;<br>We have a lot to talk about, but I&#8217;m talking too much.&nbsp; Let me yield the floor to you, Taoiseach.&nbsp; And &#8212; and you have my best wishes for &#8212; I know you&#8217;re looking good, feeling good, but I&#8217;m looking forward to you getting cleared as quickly as you can.<br>&nbsp;<br>PRIME MINISTER MARTIN:&nbsp; Well, thank you very much indeed, President.&nbsp; And last year, we met virtually across the Atlantic.&nbsp; This year, we&#8217;re meeting virtually across the road.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; So, we&#8217;re getting closer.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But I&#8217;m feeling good.&nbsp; And I think that reminds us of the importance of vaccines, and &#8212; because vaccines prevent severe illness.&nbsp; And it reminds us of that can- &#8212; central message we give to people: Get vaccinated if you&#8217;re not vaccinated.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, of course, it is unfortunate, but it&#8217;s no more than that.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I share with you our horror at the barbaric attack on the civilians of Ukraine.&nbsp; And I want to take this opportunity to genuinely salute your leadership &#8212; it&#8217;s firm, it&#8217;s determined, it&#8217;s strong, it&#8217;s measured in the teeth of this crisis &#8212; and, particularly, your capacity to marshal like-minded democracies.&nbsp; The U.S., the European Union, the United Kingdom, the other &#8212; Canada, and other like-minded democracies are coming together to respond in an unprecedented way to this barbaric attack on the women and children of Ukraine.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our thoughts are with them and all the young people who are dying because of this unjustifiable and immoral war on their people by the regime of Vladimir Putin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think it&#8217;s extremely important that we keep this unity of purpose over the coming while.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Ireland stands ready to do everything we possibly can on the humanitarian front and in supporting the broadest and widest sanctions possible to keep the pressure on and to get this war ended, because there&#8217;s simply too much suffering.&nbsp; And it’s heartrending to see the appalling loss of life and also the terrible trauma on the children of Ukraine and their mothers as they flee this war zone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we&#8217;re very seized by this in Ireland.&nbsp; And the response has been &#8212; has been great to behold, in terms of the people of Ireland who want to do everything they possibly can here.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I also just thank you again, in respect of the Good Friday Agreement, your steadfast support, and that of Speaker Pelosi and our friends on the Hill, in giving a very clear message in respect of how important the Good Friday Agreement is in respect of &#8212; of stability and peace on the island of Ireland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And over the vast number of days, as I&#8217;ve been here, we&#8217;ve also witnessed once again that two-way, very robust economic relationship between the United States and &#8212; and Ireland.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a two-way relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I met Irish companies yesterday who are creating 100,000 jobs in the U.S. now.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s because of that partnership between Ireland, Europe, and the U.S.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I look forward to discussing these issues in greater detail.&nbsp; But, again, to say that it&#8217;s wonderful to meet with you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we met in Glasgow recently.&nbsp; We had a good chinwag there, in respect of a number of issues.&nbsp; But, again, that &#8212; that also illustrated that partnership between Europe and the U.S. in terms of the existential crisis of our time &#8212; climate change.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, great to have this opportunity to meet with you, President.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; I want to say one thing while the press is here before they leave, and that is: What Ireland is doing now, what you are doing, taking in Ukrainian refugees, speaks so loudly about your principles.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s amazing, and I want to publicly compliment you for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think you&#8217;ve already brought in over 7,000 or so refugees from Ukraine, and you&#8217;re prepared to do more.&nbsp; So you’ve &#8212; thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I just want to make sure everybody knows that.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRIME MINISTER MARTIN:&nbsp; It’s our duty.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Earlier this month, the Biden-Harris Administration released the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/covidplan/">National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan</a>, a roadmap to move the country forward safely and continue to fight COVID-19 as Americans get back to their more normal routines. &nbsp;Today the Administration is launching the Clean Air in Buildings Challenge, a key component of the President’s Plan, that calls on all building owners and operators, schools, colleges and universities, and organizations of all kinds to adopt key strategies to improve indoor air quality in their buildings and reduce the spread of COVID-19.&nbsp;<br><br>The Clean Air in Buildings Challenge is a call to action for leaders and building owners and operators of all types to assess their indoor air quality and make ventilation and air filtration improvements to help keep occupants safe. As part of the Challenge, today, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a best practices guide for improving indoor air quality and reducing the risk of spreading dangerous airborne particles. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/clean-air-buildings-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This guide</a>&nbsp;– developed in collaboration with the Department of Energy, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other federal agencies – contains a set of clear recommendations organized into four groups:</p>



<ol><li><em>Create a clean indoor air action plan</em> that assesses indoor air quality, plans for upgrades and improvements, and includes HVAC inspections and maintenance.</li><li><em>Optimize fresh air ventilation</em> by bringing in and circulating clean outdoor air indoors.</li><li><em>Enhance air filtration and cleaning</em> using the central HVAC system and in-room air cleaning devices.</li><li><em>Engage the building community</em> by communicating with building occupants to increase awareness, commitment, and participation.</li></ol>



<p>Under each of these recommendation areas, EPA’s best practices guide lays out clear-cut actions building owners and operators can implement. The best practices guide is designed to serve as a menu of improvements to choose from. The guide includes quick steps that all organizations can take right away as a starting place, as well as resources to help plan for longer-term investments and improvements.&nbsp;<br><br>The Biden Administration and Congress have provided hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds that can be used in schools, public buildings, and other settings to improve indoor air quality. The American Rescue Plan provided <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-state-local-and-tribal-governments/state-and-local-fiscal-recovery-funds">$350 billion for state and local governments</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.ed.gov/improving-ventilation-schools-colleges-and-universities-prevent-covid-19">$122 billion for schools</a>, that can be used to support making ventilation and filtration upgrades. These American Rescue Plan dollars are being put to work in communities around the country in improving Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. Funding within the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund program and the Elementary and Secondary School Education Relief program can be spent on inspection, testing, and maintenance of current ventilation systems; purchasing portable air filtration units, with HEPA air filters; purchasing MERV-13 (or higher) filters for HVAC system and air conditioners; purchasing fans; repairing windows and/or doors; servicing, upgrading, or replacing HVAC systems consistent with industry standards; and more.<br><br>As detailed in the National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan, the Administration will continue to advance indoor air quality in buildings in additional ways, including:</p>



<ul><li>Supporting state, local, and Tribal governments as well as school districts to make ventilation improvements and upgrades using American Rescue Plan (ARP) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funds.&nbsp; The Administration will work closely with public sector partners like schools to provide guidance and technical assistance to make these improvements and connect them to agency resources on indoor air quality.<br></li><li>Building public awareness around ventilation and filtration improvements to reduce disease spread in buildings. The Administration will build public awareness and communicate with the public on how ventilation and good indoor air quality are key factors in keeping Americans safe while inside buildings. The Administration will launch efforts to explain what good ventilation and air filtration look like as an important component of helping to reduce disease spread, and how buildings of any kind can pursue improvements to their ventilation and air filtration strategies.<br></li><li>Highlighting actions taken by buildings to achieve clean, healthy air quality through a recognition program. While the Administration invites all buildings to take actions from the Clean Air in Buildings Challenge, the Administration will also foster ways to recognize steps taken by buildings to improve indoor air quality and protect their communities. Similar to how programs like LEED, Fitwel, and WELL recognize buildings for their environmental and health impacts, this new effort between the federal government and external experts will develop ways to recognize steps taken by building owners for the health and safety of their communities and their achievements in improving air filtration and ventilation systems to protect and promote public health.<br></li><li>Catalyzing science and technology innovation to reduce indoor disease transmission. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in coordination with other partners through the Pandemic Innovation Task Force, is identifying opportunities to drive innovation and implementation of technologies to support clean indoor air in buildings and reduce disease transmission. OSTP will also host a series of public engagements to provide the latest science, tools, and best practices on improving indoor air quality.</li></ul>

<p>I called on Jeff Zients to lead my Administration’s COVID-19 response because there is no one better at delivering results than Jeff.</p>



<p>COVID-19 is the greatest public health crisis we’ve faced in my lifetime and it required the country to build from scratch an emergency response infrastructure that could quickly and equitably get people life-saving protections. Jeff put his decades of management experience to work formulating and executing on a plan to build the infrastructure we needed to deliver vaccines, tests, treatment, and masks to hundreds of millions of Americans.</p>



<p>When Jeff took this job, less than 1% of Americans were fully vaccinated; fewer than half our schools were open; and unlike much of the developed world, America lacked any at-home COVID tests.&nbsp; Today, almost 80% of adults are fully vaccinated; over 100 million are boosted; virtually every school is open; and hundreds of millions of at-home tests are distributed every month.&nbsp; In addition, the US leads the global effort to fight COVID, delivering more free vaccines to other countries than every other nation on Earth. &nbsp;The progress that he and his team have made is stunning and even more important consequential.&nbsp;Lives have been saved.</p>



<p>Jeff spent the last 14 months working tirelessly to help combat COVID.&nbsp; He is a man of service and an expert manager. I will miss his counsel and I’m grateful for his service.</p>



<p>Thanks to all the progress we’ve made, Americans are safely moving back to more normal routines, using the effective new tools we have to enable us to reduce severe COVID cases and make workplaces and schools safer.&nbsp; But our work in combatting COVID is far from done.&nbsp;&nbsp; We must continue the effort to provide more vaccines and boosters.&nbsp; We must get a vaccine approved for the youngest children.&nbsp; We must continue to improve how our schools and workplaces cope with COVID.&nbsp; We must take special care to protect the vulnerable from COVID, even as many restrictions are lifted.&nbsp; We need to provide tests, and treatments, and masks.&nbsp; We must fight the virus overseas, prepare for new waves, and new variants – all of which can be coming.&nbsp; And we must work with Congress to fund these vital steps, as time is running out to stay ahead of the virus.</p>



<p>To lead this effort, I am excited to name Dr. Ashish Jha as the new White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator. Dr. Jha is one of the leading public health experts in America, and a well known figure to many Americans from his wise and calming public presence. And as we enter a new moment in the pandemic – executing on my National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan and managing the ongoing risks from COVID – Dr. Jha is the perfect person for the job.</p>



<p>I appreciate both Jeff and Dr. Jha for working closely to ensure a smooth transition, and I look forward to continued progress in the months ahead.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">National Building Museum<br>Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>7:39 P.M. EDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Hello, hello, hello.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; Really.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Please. &nbsp;Thank you very much.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Caitriona, thank you for that introduction.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s good to be back at this wonderful event to see so many friends &#8212; from members of Congress to leaders of faith, business, philanthropy, and the arts and the sciences.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I&#8217;ve &#8212; to everyone at the Ireland Funds: Thank you for deepening the ties of the Irish diaspora throughout the world. Your work proves that the Irish are home everywhere &#8212; everywhere.&nbsp; And as &#8212; Taoiseach and Mrs. Martin I hope feel at home here in America.&nbsp; It&#8217;s an honor to welcome you back, Taoiseach.&nbsp; (Applause.) &nbsp;It’s an honor to welcome you back.&nbsp;<br><br>In 2009, at the White House Shamrock Ceremony, when you were foreign minister and I was vice president.&nbsp; The following year, my wife Jill and I were honored to host you both at the &#8212; at the Naval Observatory at a St. Patrick&#8217;s Day breakfast.&nbsp; And I look forward to continuing our friendship and discussing our partnership tomorrow at the White House when we both have come full circle.&nbsp; You&#8217;re Taoiseach and I&#8217;m President; what the hell are we going to do?&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.) &nbsp;Well, it’s &#8212; it’d be pretty personal for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>It’s been 165 years, like many of you &#8212; 165 years since my great-great-grandparents left County Mayo and County Louth aboard coffin ships to cross the Atlantic.&nbsp; Not sure all what &#8212; they knew what they were leaving.&nbsp; They weren&#8217;t sure what they were going to be seeing.&nbsp;<br><br>The Blewitts and the Finnegans eventually settled in Scranton, Pennsylvania.&nbsp; And &#8212; and that&#8217;s where my parents met and were married.&nbsp; It was where my mother, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, was born and later met &#8212; married my father, Joseph R. Biden, Sr.&nbsp; He has &#8212; he had the saving grace, on his mother&#8217;s side, of having a Hanafee from Galway.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the only thing that saved him.&nbsp; And you all think I&#8217;m kidding.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not.&nbsp; (Laughter.) &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And it was in Scranton where I was born, and I inherited my mother&#8217;s side of the family&#8217;s overwhelming pride &#8212; overwhelming pride in being Irish &#8212; a pride that spoke to both continents’ heart and soul, and drew from the old and the new.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>One of my great-great-uncles wrote his “Amerikay” letter back to his loved ones in Ireland, yearning to be home.&nbsp; And he said &#8212; he wrote, “If the road was made of furze…” &#8212; which is a yellow flower with thorns &#8212; he said, “If a road were made of furze from America to Ireland, I&#8217;d walk it in my bare feet.”&nbsp;<br><br>My great-grandfather, Edward Francis Blewitt, was only the second Catholic in the history of the state of Pennsylvania to be elected to the State Senate at that time in 1906 &#8212; at a time when many Catholics weren&#8217;t elected to office, especially coming out of the coal mine regions of Scranton.<br><br>You know, we had a &#8212; he had an engineering degree from Lafayette College and the heart of an Irish poet.&nbsp; In 1919, one of his over 100 poems that he wrote &#8212; and thankfully my uncle left them to me &#8212; he wrote of “his Ireland.”&nbsp; And the concluding stanza he wrote was:&nbsp;<br><br><em>“From the fairest land, except my own,</em><br><em>‘Neath stars and moon and sun,</em><br><em>a citadel of liberty,</em><br><em>My mother&#8217;s land, a rún.”</em><br><br>A lot has happened since his “mother&#8217;s land,&nbsp;<em>a rún</em>.”&nbsp; Things are so much better in Ireland today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Like so many Americans, that pride has been passed down in every generation of our family.&nbsp; And I might add, my family &#8212; I don&#8217;t know where they&#8217;re sitting &#8212; my brother Jimmy; his wife, Sara; and my niece, Missy.&nbsp; Where are you guys?&nbsp; They&#8217;re here.&nbsp; What table are you at?&nbsp; (Applause.) &nbsp;There you go.&nbsp;<br><br>Unfortunately for Jimmy, we&#8217;re often mistaken as the same person.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Early on when I was Vice President &#8212; true story &#8212; there was a threat as I was driving from &#8212; from the Vice President’s Residence to the White House, to work.&nbsp; And they suggested that Jimmy ride in the front limousine.&nbsp; (Laughter.) &nbsp;You&#8217;re a hell of a brother, Jim.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; You&#8217;re a hell of a brother.&nbsp;<br><br>As a matter of fact, Taoiseach, Micheál &#8212; I &#8212; when I was Vice President, I hosted one of your predecessors, Enda Kenny, who I got to know in the Naval Observatory.&nbsp; I&#8217;d always have a St. Patrick&#8217;s Day breakfast.&nbsp; And afterwards, I took him to the Oval Office to meet with Barack, which was the usual deal, which will &#8212; and he turned to Barack after &#8212; I think it was the fifth year or sixth year in.&nbsp; And he turned to Barack and said, “God, Barack, let the boy come home.&nbsp; Send him home, will you?”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And Barack said, “Get the hell home to Ireland.”&nbsp;<br><br>I’d been to Ireland many times but never to make a connection with my heritage and my family.&nbsp; In fact, six years ago, three generations of my family walked along Garden Street in Ballina, in County Mayo, like our ferbea- &#8212; our forebears, the Blewitts, did.&nbsp; We visited a church in County Louth, where the Finnegans were baptized, at Cooley Peninsula, down at the tip near Carlingford, where they made their living in both the land and the sea.&nbsp; And we also went to Lily Finnegan’s pub &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; for spirits and to meet some of my distant relatives.<br><br>(Audience member whistles.)&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; You know it.<br><br>And I got to speak to the Irish people at Dublin Castle and thought about my Grandpa Finnegan.&nbsp; We also visited Trinity College.&nbsp; And my Grandpa Finnegan was a student of Irish history &#8212; a magnificent place &#8212; but he always would point out to me Trinity College was built to wipe out Catholicism in the island.&nbsp;<br><br>And so, I had the great honor of being &#8212; being given an honorary degree &#8212; an honorary doctorate degree.&nbsp; And I spoke to the graduating class at a magnificent place, and I must admit I started &#8212; I said, “Grandpa Finnegan, forgive me but it&#8217;s no longer &#8212; no longer a mortal sin.&nbsp; It&#8217;s okay.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And I received the honorary doctorate so I could catch up with my wife, Dr. Jill Biden.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>And a great and unexpected honor: I was inducted into the University Philosophic Society, the oldest one in the world.&nbsp; And that night, the Ireland Fund &#8212; you guys hosted the dinner for my family in Ireland.&nbsp; And &#8212; and I just want to thank you.&nbsp; A hundred thousand welcomes.&nbsp; I never pronounce it correctly, but it&#8217;s<em>Céad míle</em>&nbsp;&#8212; I got to remember it now &#8212;<em>Céad míle fáilte</em>.&nbsp; Is that right?<br><br>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Céad míle fáilte</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Fáilte</em>.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; A hundred thousand welcomes.&nbsp; I have trouble speaking Gaelic and English.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>But it was a trip I’ll always remember.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even made &#8212; it even made clear what my mother imbued in her children and her grandchildren: an absolute certitude that we were equal to every person, and every person was equal to us.&nbsp; That was my mom &#8212; the Speaker has heard me say this before.&nbsp; My mom would say, “Remember, nobody is better than you.&nbsp; And everyone is your equal.”&nbsp; That everyone deserved to be treated with a word, I think, the Irish use more than any other group of people &#8212; treated with “dignity.”&nbsp; Dignity.<br><br>My father would no more walk by the Chairman of the Board of the DuPont Company or the shoeshine guy in the DuPont Hotel without saying “hello” to both.&nbsp;<br><br>It’s a certitude built on both our nations that we’ve always shared a deep spark.&nbsp; Everything between us runs deep &#8212; the literature, the poetry, the sadness, the joy, but, most of all, our resilience.&nbsp; Despite everything, we’ve never stopped being dreamers.&nbsp; And I think we Irish are the only people in the world who actually are nostalgic for the future.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>Think about it.&nbsp; You think I’m kidding.&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>But, of course, that means dealing with the present.&nbsp; At this time, in our time, we’ve seen more change and challenge, I believe, than any time in generations.&nbsp; A once-in-a-century pandemic.&nbsp; An economic unease and anxiety.&nbsp; An existential threat of the climate crisis.&nbsp; And what we see today in Ukraine: an unprovoked war of aggression and just a vicious, vicious, vicious treatment of the Ukrainian people &#8212; bombing hospitals and homes and nurseries.&nbsp;<br><br>A march of reactionary forces of nationalism, nativism, and isolationism; of autocracies, not just in Europe &#8212; we’ve see it around the world; we’ve seen it here in America.<br><br>But I also see this: the strength, necessity, and endurance of democracy.&nbsp; That we, the people &#8212; we’re the most unique nation in the world because of our backgrounds.&nbsp; We’re the only nation built on the notion of an idea &#8212; not ethnicity, not geography, but an idea that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I really mean it.&nbsp;<br><br>We’ve never lived up to it completely, but we have never walked away from it.&nbsp; Wa- &#8212; opportunity, the rule of law of equal rights and dignity for everybody.<br><br>And while terrible things have happened on both sides of our shores &#8212; violence, civil unrest, racial and religious discrimination &#8212; we’re nations and a people that are self-reflective and self-corrective.&nbsp; Nations where hope runs deep and optimism reigns.&nbsp; Optimism that’s brave and digs deep.<br><br>My mother used to have an expression &#8212; for real. &nbsp;She’d say, “Joe, remember: As long as you’re alive, you have an obligation to strive.&nbsp; And you’re not dead until you’ve seen the face of God.”&nbsp; That was her anthem.&nbsp; And I can tell you, every one of my siblings and cousins &#8212; it was beat into our heads.&nbsp;<br><br>That’s what I see in the Republic of Ireland today &#8212; a global force in culture and in the arts; leaders on the world stage; members of the United Nations Security Council; a country with a past that tugs at our hearts and a future that’s going to shape the world.<br><br>Eavan Boland, the late Irish poet, who fought &#8212; who taught here in America at Stanford University, she wrote of today’s Republic of Ireland.&nbsp; She said:<br><br><em>“Our island that was once</em><br><em>Settled and removed on the edge</em><br><em>Of Europe is now [the] bridge</em><br><em>To the world.”&nbsp;</em><br><br>It has that capacity.&nbsp;<br><br>Tonight, let us salute that bridge to the world.&nbsp; A bridge that for generations has gone back and forth between Ireland and the United States, and that grows stronger and more necessary as every year passes.&nbsp; And I mean it.&nbsp; I mean it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We feel it across America, especially during the week of St. Patrick’s Day in cities and towns big and small.<br><br>And the White House tomorrow will be decked in green.&nbsp; And I’ll also be thinking about the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick’s Day event in Scranton and Lackawanna County, which my great grandfather helped found &#8212; where it started for my family here in America.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I’ll be thinking about the annual morning mass at St. Patrick’s Church in Wilmington, Delaware, where my son Beau and my son Hunter were members.&nbsp; And we called it St. Patrick’s Day Society that supported the church and community.&nbsp; The society was started in 1990 by a dear friend, late Father Jim Trainor, who gathered a group of friends in a tough neighborhood.&nbsp; It used to be an all Irish neighborhood back at the turn of the 18- &#8212; excuse me &#8212; in the turn of the 20th century, but it’s now a minority neighborhood; it’s in trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And in his home &#8212; he’d invite us &#8212; we found a way to ground a day of celebration with a greater sense of purpose.&nbsp; And we built a sense of community to restore hope in those struggling, to thread that common bonds of respect, dignity, and love for &#8212; among all people, in every station.<br><br>Over the years, our St. Patrick’s Day Society in Wilmington, Delaware, has raised millions of dollars, like you have done &#8212; and so much more &#8212; for countless people of all backgrounds in the community.&nbsp;<br><br>It all started with an idea &#8212; with a spark of passion and compassion. &nbsp;And it grew and grew ever since.&nbsp; A proud tradition of my hometown that reflects the souls of two great nations, and providing that when you’re Irish &#8212; proving it when you’re Irish, when you’re American: Home is everywhere.&nbsp; What a gift.&nbsp; What a blessing.<br><br>Let me close with this: By the time my great-great-grandfather Owen Finnegan, a shoemaker, boarded a coffin ship in 1844, another shoemaker named Joseph Kearny from Moneygo- &#8212; excuse me &#8212; from Moneygall &#8212; ship &#8212; on another ship, five weeks before &#8212; he was President Obama’s great-great-grandfather.&nbsp; There’s a good chance they knew each other, I’m told when I was in Ireland, because they were both &#8212; there were both shoemakers.&nbsp; And they left everything behind for an uncertain future.<br><br>But I wonder, in all their dreams, whether they could have ever dreamt that each of their grandsons would one day be President of the United States of America.&nbsp; That’s America.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s America.&nbsp; Or as my grandfather Ambrose Finnegan would say, “That’s the Irish of it.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>And now it’s up to all of us to keep the sense of possibility for every person who gives up everything in search of a better life.&nbsp; That’s been our history.&nbsp; It’s our present.&nbsp; And if we&#8217;re lucky, it will be our future.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>A thousand thanks to all of you.&nbsp; One night in advance: Happy St. Patrick’s Day.&nbsp;<br><br>May God bless you all.&nbsp; And may God protect our troops.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you so very much.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>7:55 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>3:09 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; A couple of items for all of you at the top.&nbsp; Today marks one year since eight people &#8212; six of them women of Asian descent &#8212; were tragically killed by a gunman who attacked three Asian-run businesses.</p>



<p>In the aftermath of that horrific attack, the President and Vice President traveled to Atlanta to meet with leaders of the Asian American community and hear about pain &#8212; the pain and fear that too many Asian Americans have felt since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Today, Erika Mori- &#8212; Moritsugu, Deputy Assistant to the President and AAPI Senior Liaison, is in Atlanta representing the White House as the community mourns the victims of this awful tragedy.</p>



<p>Ambassador Katherine Tai, our U.S. Trade Representative and Co-Chair of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders, also spoke at a vigil in Michigan to stand against Asian Ameri- &#8212; anti-Asian hate past and present.</p>



<p>On this somber day, our administration remains fully committed to reducing the gun violence that terrorizes &#8212; terrorizes our communities and to advancing safety, inclusion, and belonging for all Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders.</p>



<p>I wanted to make a note on gas prices.&nbsp; Right now, oil prices are $94 per barrel.&nbsp; When oil was at this level one month ago, the average cost of a gallon of gasoline was $3.49.&nbsp; And yet now, the average cost of gas is $4.32.</p>



<p>When it comes to oil and gas prices, many accept that gas prices rise quickly but fall slowly &#8212; the so-called “rockets-and-feathers” phenomenon.</p>



<p>But President Biden rejects that.&nbsp; Americans deserve relief, and fast, as oil prices fall.</p>



<p>Retail gasoline prices are updated at least daily, and if gas retailers’ costs are going down, they need to immediately pass those savings onto consumers.</p>



<p>So, I will reiterate what the President said to oil and gas companies last week: The invasion of Ukraine and the volatility of the oil market is no excuse for excessive price increases, profit padding, or any effort to exploit American consumers.  No one should capitalize on Putin’s aggression by taking advantage of American families.</p>



<p>And this chart, which you see here, shows both the price of crude oil, and you see where it is as it relates to the price of gasoline.&nbsp; And as you&#8217;ve seen it gone down &#8212; go down, the price of gasoline obviously has not gone down.&nbsp; So that is the explanation of that particular chart.</p>



<p>I also just wanted to note, before we get to questions, that in some good news, we saw history made yesterday with the strong bipartisan confirmation of Shalanda Young, the first Black woman to serve as Director of the Office of Management and Budget.</p>



<p>For the past year, she has served as a key advisor to the President, a member of the economic team.&nbsp; She has led the development of the President’s budget and helped effectively implement his agenda and vision across the entire federal government.</p>



<p>She’s not just making history, she’s exceptionally qualified and has vast budget experience from her years leading staff on the House Appropriations Committee.&nbsp; So, we&#8217;re thrilled to have her as our confirmed director.</p>



<p>Finally &#8212; I know you all just heard the President give remarks on this, but for clarity&#8217;s sake and to make sure everybody fully understands the totality of assistance, what the President announced today was an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine, bringing the total U.S. security assistance committed to Ukraine to $1 billion in just the past week and more than $2 billion since the start of the Biden administration and, more specifically, since last March.</p>



<p>There is additional security assistance in the omnibus the President signed into law yesterday, but we&#8217;re also working with the Ukrainians and others on delivery mechanisms of that.&nbsp; So, what he outlined today is the additional $800 billion from that.</p>



<p>And this assistance, as you heard him say, it will take the form of direct transfers of equipment from the Department of Defense to the Ukrainian military to help them defend their country against Russians’ unpro- &#8212; Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion.&nbsp; It also includes U.S.-produced short-range air defense systems the Ukrainians have been using to great effect &#8212; systems they are trained on.</p>



<p>We have also identified and are helping the Ukrainians acquire additional longer-range systems, on which their forces, again, are already trained, as well as additional munitions for these systems.&nbsp; And we will continue to work with Allies and partners to transfer equipment to Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At least 30 countries to date have provided security assistance to Ukraine since the invasion began.&nbsp; And in 2022, the Department of State authorized third-party transfers of defensive equipment from more than 14 countries, a number that continues to grow as Allies and partners increase support to Ukraine.</p>



<p>Chris, why don’t you kick us off?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; First off, I just wanted to note this is your 200th briefing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, wow.&nbsp; Time flies when you&#8217;re having fun.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we will celebrate with a lot of questions.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay, 200 &#8212; let&#8217;s do it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To start us off, the White House has said the Russian actions in Ukraine are under close scrutiny for potential war crimes, but today President Biden directly labeled Putin a, quote, &#8220;war criminal.&#8221;&nbsp; Has something changed in the administration&#8217;s assessment?&nbsp; What brought this new remark from the President today?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think the President was &#8212; the President&#8217;s remarks speak for themselves.&nbsp; He was speaking from his heart and speaking from what he&#8217;s seen on television, which is barbaric actions by a brutal dictator, through his invasion of a foreign country.</p>



<p>There is a legal process that continues to &#8212; is underway, continues to be underway at the State Department.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a process that they would have any updates on.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, another question on the military assistance.&nbsp; Is the White House, is the administration facilitating the transfer of S-300 anti-air missiles?&nbsp; How is the U.S. facilitating that?&nbsp; How many might be provided to Ukraine?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let me just provide to you &#8212; as I&#8217;ve educated myself a little bit on weapon systems over the past few days, I thought this might be helpful to you.&nbsp; So, S-300s are anti-aircraft systems.&nbsp; We are providing Stingers, who are also anti-aircraft systems.&nbsp; There are a range of anti-aircraft systems that different countries have around the world.</p>



<p>So, as I noted, I know that President Zelenskyy called out specifically S-300s.&nbsp; And while I&#8217;m not going to get into specifics for security reasons, we are continuing to work with our Allies and key partners to surge new assistance, including Soviet- or Russian-origin anti-aircraft systems, which is exactly what that is.</p>



<p>But what we&#8217;re talking about here is how to provide them a range of anti-aircraft systems that will help them do exactly what they&#8217;ve been doing, which is to shoot down planes.&nbsp; And part of what the President announced today was additional Stingers that serve exactly that purpose.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; But given that the S-300 has a much longer range than the Stingers, is that part of the administration&#8217;s plan to find a way to facilitate that specific transfer of weapons?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Without getting into specific systems, there are a range of anti-aircraft systems that do have longer range. We are continuing to consult with our Allies and key partners to surge that assistance, but I&#8217;m not going to get into more specifics.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the last question is: The Federal Reserve raised rates today to help fight &#8212; tame inflation.&nbsp; Is the administration confident that the Fed can beat inflation through rate hikes and not risk a recession?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would note that Chairman Powell spoke to exactly that question today.&nbsp; So, I would point you to his specific comments answering that question, where he did express confidence in the ability to take the steps he announced and avoid that.</p>



<p>I would note that while they &#8212; we respect the independence of the Federal Reserve, as you of course &#8212; as we have said many times &#8212; the President has also said in the past that he recognizes not only their independence, but that it is appropriate and necessary for the Federal Reserve to recalibrace [sic] &#8212; recalibrate their &#8212; that &#8212; their support to maintain stable prices.&nbsp; And obviously, they made an announcement today.</p>



<p>As it relates to &#8212; we, obviously, closely watch here from the administration and closely monitor all risks.&nbsp; And we continue to believe that the United States economy is positioned well to deal with the challenges ahead, even as we continue to monitor.</p>



<p>And, obviously, there are events that impact the economy, including an invasion of a foreign country.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re seeing that impact as well play out in the economic data.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back on this question of labeling Putin a &#8220;war criminal.&#8221;&nbsp; I mean, this war has now been going on for three weeks.&nbsp; So far, the President has declined to use this label.&nbsp; As you note, there is an ongoing, sort of, formal process before you can use this term.&nbsp; So, something must have changed for the President to feel like he can take this additional step today.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; What else is he seeing?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President was answering a direct question that was asked and responding to what he has seen on television.</p>



<p>We have all seen barbaric acts, horrific acts by a foreign dictator in a country that is threatening and taking the lives of civilians, impacting hospitals, women who are pregnant, journalists, others.&nbsp; And I think he was answering a direct question.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; The administration is making it very clear &#8212; and publicly &#8212; how much assistance the U.S. is providing to Ukraine.&nbsp; Whether we are fighting in this war or not, the U.S. is obviously heavily involved.&nbsp; Putin certainly knows all of this.&nbsp; He knows where this equipment is coming from.&nbsp; Is there any concern that you run the risk that he may view this as the kind of direct U.S. involvement, the direct confrontation that you are trying to avoid?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, all the equipment that we&#8217;re providing, whether it&#8217;s Stingers or Javelins or counter artillery &#8212; counter mortar radar, counter UA- &#8212; UAV tracking radars, anti-armor systems, unmanned aerial systems &#8212; this is all defensive equipment and materials.&nbsp; It is more than we have ever provided to Ukraine in the past.&nbsp; It is a significant amount of assistance that we have expedited the delivery on.&nbsp; And we will continue to do exactly that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as our Department of Defense &#8212; and they can certainly speak to themselves &#8212; for themselves &#8212; they do risk assessments, they assess what the impact will be of the types of assistance they&#8217;re providing.&nbsp; We&#8217;re obviously watching how the types of assistance we have provided have helped the Ukrainians courageously and bravely fight back, and we&#8217;re giving them more of that assistance.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve also given them additional types of assistance we had not yet provided to them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But again, these are all defensive weapons systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You have noted from the podium that Putin has shown no signs of changing course.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve also noted that there are significant consequences that Putin could still face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even with this additional aid that you&#8217;re providing today, it seems there are still other options on the table.&nbsp; So why hold back?&nbsp; Why not use every tool at your disposal now to spare additional lives?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think if you look at the range of tools that we&#8217;ve used to date, we have &#8212; we have implemented more economic sanctions than we have on any other economy in the world.&nbsp; You could compare it, potentially, to Iran or maybe North Korea, but Russia is a much more significant economy, a larger economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so I wouldn&#8217;t say that we are holding back in that sense.&nbsp; We do have additional steps we can take, as we&#8217;ve talked about a bit in here before.&nbsp; Obviously, the SWIFT banking system and the implementation of those sanctions happens institution by institution.&nbsp; There are additional individuals that can be sanctioned.&nbsp; We can have new targets.&nbsp; We can deepen the severity of sanctions on existing targets.&nbsp; We can further eject Russia from international economic or- &#8212; the international economic order.&nbsp; We can further dire- &#8212; deny Russia the capacity to mon- &#8212; modernize and diversify its economy, like we have with the export controls and the cutting off of access to a lot of technology.&nbsp; And we can further expose and hold to account the kleptocracy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are additional actions we have, additional options we have.&nbsp; And we can take them.&nbsp; And that is a decision that we would make through a discussion internally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what are you waiting for?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We are &#8212; we have additional escalatory steps that we can take.&nbsp; But I would just note that we have not held back.&nbsp; We have done more economic sanctions and had more &#8212; put in place more financial consequences than we have in any circumstance ever in the world.&nbsp; So I wouldn&#8217;t say that is holding back in any capacity.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, does the White House have any insight or assessment of the negotiations between Ukraine and Russia?&nbsp; President Zelenskyy seemed to indicate there&#8217;d been some progress, but President Putin&#8217;s remarks later did not make the same impression.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We obviously stay in very close touch with the Ukrainians.&nbsp; But what I would note is we haven&#8217;t seen any effort to de-escalate from President Putin and from the Russian military.</p>



<p>So while we will continue to be very supportive, in a range of ways, of diplomatic efforts &#8212; whether that is engaging directly with the Ukrainians, with the Europeans; you saw obviously Jake Sullivan had a call with his counterpart this morning as well &#8212; but we also are providing a range of security assistance and economic assistance to make sure we&#8217;re strengthening Ukraine as they go into these discussions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s hard to have &#8212; hard to have negotiations that are going to be effective if, you know, one party is continuing to escalate.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Zelenskyy, in his remarks to Congress today, again made his request for a no-fly zone.&nbsp; He no doubt is aware of President Biden&#8217;s position on that.&nbsp; Is there any scenario in which President Biden would change his mind?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, let me say that the President watched the speech &#8212; I know some of you asked this, so let me just do this now.&nbsp; He watched the speech from his residence, in his private library.</p>



<p>As you heard him say, he thought that President Zelenskyy was passionate, was powerful.&nbsp; And certainly he &#8212; and he watched the totality of it. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We are in very close touch with the Ukrainians.&nbsp; Nothing that he asked for or said today was a surprise in that sense.&nbsp; And if we were President Zelenskyy, we would be asking for everything possible as well and continuing to ask for it, because he is watching his country and his people be attacked and brutalized by President Putin and the Russian military.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But how President Biden makes decisions is through the prism of our own national security.&nbsp; And as we&#8217;ve said before, a no-fly zone would require implementation, it would require us potentially shooting down Russian planes, NATO shooting down Russian planes.&nbsp; And we are not interested in getting into World War Three.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last &#8212; just lastly, does the White House view Russia as being ready to go back and allow the Iran nuclear deal to come forward?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we can&#8217;t blissfully speak for Russia &#8212;&nbsp; I&#8217;m sanctioned; they especially wouldn’t let me speak for them, I guess, now &#8212; I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s changed.</p>



<p>But I would say that Russia does not want Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t either.&nbsp; While we have a range of strong disagreements with them, we can’t speak for their intentions here.&nbsp; Certainly, we believe it&#8217;s in both of our interests for this to move forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Jen, does the President believe that it would be important for President Zelenskyy to be at the NATO summit next week, as long as it is safe for him to do so?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I have not discussed that exactly with the President.&nbsp; The President is going there to meet with NATO partners and Allies.&nbsp; Obviously, President Zelenskyy is &#8212; his country is in the middle of a war.&nbsp; So I have not talked to him about that specifically.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to ask you about Jake Sullivan &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; speaking with his Russian counterpart.&nbsp; The Russian readout said that this happened at the U.S.’s initiative, and the NSC’s readout said that if Russia is serious about diplomacy, then Moscow should stop attacking Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You&#8217;ve obviously consistently said from the podium that the door to diplomacy is never closed.&nbsp; Are we seeing, though, a ramp-up in diplomatic efforts with Russia right now?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, this is the most senior conversation between the U.S. and Russian officials since Secretary Blinken last spoke with Foreign Minister Lavrov.</p>



<p>I would note that we have maintained direct and indirect contact with the Russians, through our embassy and officials there, Ambass- &#8212; including through Ambassador Sullivan, and we also have a military deconfliction channel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we requested this call to clearly lay out our commitment to continuing to impose costs on Russia if they do not stop attacking Ukrainian cities and towns, and to warn them about the consequences and implications of Russia potentially using chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s important to convey those &#8212; those consequences directly, and this was an opportunity to do that.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just one final question on a different topic.&nbsp; The administration has marked the one-year anniversary of the Atlanta spa shootings and spoken about some of the actions that the federal government has tried to take.&nbsp; As you know, this week, an Asian woman in New York, a 67-year-old woman, was hit more than 125 times, was stomped on, was called a racial slur.&nbsp; Obviously, that video is very sickening to watch.&nbsp; Do you know whether the President has seen that video?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And just what would the President&#8217;s message be to anyone in the Asian American community who feels like, well, the actions that the government is taking are not enough to stop these attacks and they say that they feel afraid?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that our message to them &#8212; I have not talked to the President about this specific video.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve seen it; a number of us have seen it.&nbsp; And as you said, it is very difficult to watch.</p>



<p>I would say that his message to them would be: Our work is not done; that we want to stand by your side and continue to stand up for you, to protect you, to call out this type of discrimination and horrific actions, as &#8212; and including in the example you gave.</p>



<p>And that what he has done is tried to elevate this type of anti-Asian hate in this country so that people are aware of it, so that communities across the country can continue in that fight as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the work clearly is not done, and we need to be steadfast in it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead, David.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, a couple of questions on today&#8217;s events.&nbsp; So, first, in the conversation that Jake Sullivan had with his Russian counterpart, he issued a very specific warning about chemical and bio.&nbsp; There was no mention in the readout of nuclear, which is obviously a concern for battlefield weapons.&nbsp; Was that a deliberate omission?&nbsp; Has that conversation taken place in a different channel?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to go back to them and see if there&#8217;s more we want to read out from the conversation.&nbsp; I think what the most important component here to take away, I hope, is that we wanted to have a direct conversation about what the consequences would be of further escalatory action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I don&#8217;t have more to read out at this point in time.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then on your answer, just before, about your concerns about the MiG planes &#8212; we went through a little bit of this yesterday &#8212; I think you just said that you didn&#8217;t want to have NATO pilots bringing down Russian planes.&nbsp; But under the administration&#8217;s policy of moving out this long-range anti-aircraft, it&#8217;s okay to have NATO equipment bringing down Russian planes, as long as it&#8217;s launched by a Ukrainian?&nbsp; Am I understanding the policy right?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think &#8212; you&#8217;ve heard us talk a fair amount about the Poland &#8212; the planes from Poland.&nbsp; And again, Poland is a sovereign country so they can make decisions on their own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we have done is done an assessment of our role and the U.S. role, and what our view would be of NATO, of this &#8212; of these planes taking off from NATO airspace.&nbsp; Again, I would note that the equipment that we&#8217;ve provided is defensive, as you know, not offensive.&nbsp; And we see that as being a difference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re also looking at &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the planes can be used for an offensive purpose and the antimissile systems &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Correct.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; cannot?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Correct.</p>



<p>Also &#8212; also, I would note that what our Department of Defense officials also assessed is what&#8217;s most effective.&nbsp; And while the Ukrainians still have squadrons of planes to utilize, as I think any military official could confirm for you, the types of assistance that we are providing today, including Stingers and other assistance that we&#8217;re amping up support for, is exactly what we feel is effective in fighting this war.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Today, in Putin’s speech, he implied that there&#8217;s going to be even greater crackdowns on civil liberties inside of Russia.&nbsp; Is there anything that you all believe that you can do, in terms of sanctions or supporting the opposition there, that you all are not already taking?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we look at all of the actions that President Putin does, and we assess what responses we may have.</p>



<p>I have nothing to predict at this point in time, but obviously, as he has taken actions, we have taken actions in response.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, specifically on the case of Aleksey Navalny, he &#8212; prosecutors there just said that they want to sentence him for a 13-year prison sentence.&nbsp; Does the White House have a response to that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think we&#8217;ve spoken a number of times in the past about the courage of Aleksey Navalny, about the role he&#8217;s played in being an outspoken advocate for freedoms in a country that has been void of them.&nbsp; And I would echo those &#8212; that response now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Can you talk a little bit about what President Biden specifically hopes to accomplish in his trip next week &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; beyond shoring up NATO Allies?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, that&#8217;s a big part of it.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a very important part, Ashley &#8212; shoring up NATO Allies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, I think from the beginning, and even before this conflict began, we have viewed rebuilding alliances in the world as a key component of what the Biden administration and President Biden could specifically do on the global stage following his predecessor’s &#8212; his predecessor’s actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what he&#8217;ll be doing &#8212; he&#8217;s &#8212; while he&#8217;s there: He&#8217;s meeting with our NATO Allies to coordinate our deterrence and defense.&nbsp; So they will obviously talk about where things are on the ground, coordinated responses, assistance we&#8217;re providing.&nbsp;<br><br>NATO, at this point, as you all know, is more united and more determined than we&#8217;ve been in decades.&nbsp; So we certainly would &#8212; would be focused on continuing that unity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He would also &#8212; he’s also going to join European leaders in a separate part of the day to discuss our work to impose economic costs on Russia.  As I noted earlier, there are obviously a range of coordinated steps and costs we&#8217;ve taken.  There&#8217;s more that we could do, we have the capacity and the ability to do, and we want to continue to do as much of that in a coordinated fashion. </p>



<p>We&#8217;re also looking to continue to provide a range of humanitarian support, especially as we&#8217;re seeing a surge of refugees continue to grow across the border, and, you know, discuss a range of ways we can address the challenges stemmed from Putin&#8217;s war in a coordinated fashion.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on a slightly lighter note, does the administration have a position on the effort in Congress to make Daylight Savings Time permanent?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I have seen those reports.&nbsp; I was trying to think of a joke; I couldn&#8217;t think of one.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have a specific &#8212; we are obviously coordinated and work closely with Congress on all legislation they consider, but I don&#8217;t have a specific position from the administration at this point of time.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it something &#8212; is the President more of a morning person or afternoon?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Because people are often divided in those ways, so I&#8217;m just curious if you could talk about that.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That is true.&nbsp; Now, to de-link it from this specific question, he is more of an evening person.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t know what analysis you&#8217;ll provide, but I&#8217;ll look forward to reading it tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Has President Biden spoken to President Zelenskyy today?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Not since this morning.&nbsp; If he does and when he does, which I&#8217;m sure he will soon, we will provide that readout to all of you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Got it.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, President Zelenskyy made a distinction between a humanitarian no-fly zone and a blanket no-fly zone.&nbsp; Does the administration view them as being different or the same thing?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, there have been descriptions of both of those over the past couple of weeks.&nbsp; And sometimes a humanitar- &#8212; and I don&#8217;t want to put words in his mouth, but a humanitarian no-fly zone can be specific geography or a portion of Western &#8212; or parts of Ukraine, whereas a no-fly zone &#8212; sometimes people refer to it as the totality of the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In our view and the view of the military, there&#8217;s not a difference in terms of the implementation and the escalatory impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, today, the Vice President spoke with the President of Slovakia, which is one of three countries that can actually provide those S-300s.&nbsp; But the readout does not mention the missile system.&nbsp; So can you tell us whether the Vice President directly asked Slovakia to provide them to Ukraine?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I can&#8217;t get into more specifics, other than to convey that we are having conversations with a range of Allies about providing additional assistance &#8212; anti-aircraft assistance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And again, there are a range of &#8212; of systems, including some of the systems that we provided and we are going to be expediting delivery of to Ukraine from the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one more on the warplanes that Zelenskyy asked for today.&nbsp; I mean, you&#8217;ve made very clear that the U.S. is opposed to doing that right now.&nbsp; I wonder if the U.S. is also discouraging other NATO Allies from providing fighter jets, even if the U.S. would not have to serve as a middleman.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Other countries can make their own sovereign decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then one more on the Asian hate crimes, because you mentioned them at the top, too.&nbsp; Do you know if the DOJ has concluded that there is not enough evidence to charge the shooter in Atlanta with a federal hate crime?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t speak to that from here.&nbsp; You&#8217;d have to ask DOJ that question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then, more broadly, since the administration adopted new policies that are meant to make it easier to identify these crimes as hate crimes, do you &#8212; can you point to any progress that &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, I&#8217;d point you to the Department of Justice, who are implementing.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Go ahead, Jacqui.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; Just one more.&nbsp; I know a lot of people have asked about the MiGs, but can you lay out for us why the administration sees MiGs as provocative and Javelins and Stingers as not provocative?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first, Javelins and Stingers are defensive weapons.&nbsp; MiGs or planes are offensive weapons, which are a different type of military system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would say the other assessment that we&#8217;ve done &#8212; not through here, not through the White House, not through the President &#8212; from &#8212; from the Department of Defense is to assess what is effective and what works in terms of fighting this war on the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that is why we provided an additional $1 billion &#8212; $800 million announced today, but $1 billion this week &#8212; of assistance, utilizing a number of the high-level military systems &#8212; Stingers, Javelins, counter-artillery, counter-mortar radar, anti-armor systems &#8212;&nbsp;that we know have been effective and we know the Ukrainians are trained on.</p>



<p>Third, Ukraine&#8217;s Air Force already has several squadrons of mission-capable aircraft, and giving them more would not significantly change their effectiveness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And finally &#8212; I touched on this in the beginning, offensive versus defensive &#8212; but we also do risk assessments from the Department of Defense about what would be escalatory and what &#8212; and that is obviously what we would like to avoid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, John Kirby has said that success for the U.S. mission in Ukraine is a free, independent, sovereign Ukraine.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve also heard that the official mission is to prevent escalation beyond Ukraine.&nbsp; Which is it?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Both are true.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we&#8217;re not specific about what exactly the desired outcome is, how do we expect to be able to be successful?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Why could &#8212; why could both not be true: a sovereign Ukraine and preventing them from expanding beyond?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, moving on to the nuclear deal, General McKenzie told the Armed Services Committee that, from everything that he can see, the IRGC is a terrorist organization.&nbsp; Is the White House willing to de-list the IRGC from the Foreign Terrorist Organization list in order to get a deal with Iran?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;re still in the negotiations, so I&#8217;m not going to speculate or outline from here what the final details look like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And these are likely the group responsible for firing missiles at U.S. facilities in Iraq.&nbsp; So as long as Americans aren&#8217;t killed, are there &#8212; are there are no consequences for something like that, all in an effort to get a nuclear deal?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, you&#8217;re speculating on something that is not even finalized.&nbsp; The deal is not finalized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What I would note &#8212; and I would just go back to why we&#8217;re negotiating this deal.&nbsp; And right now, we&#8217;re negotiating this deal because nu- &#8212; Iran&#8217;s nuclear gains are threatening U.S. interests.&nbsp; There&#8217;s urgency to taking steps to contain that, which is why we&#8217;ve been engaged so closely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that is all the result of President Trump pulling out of the deal, and Iran moving closer to having the capacity and acquiring a nuclear weapon and speeding up their breakout time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we are here thanks to the actions of the last president and the last administration.&nbsp; And it is in our interest, it is in the global interest to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead, Kristen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; How quickly can Ukraine expect to receive the list of military aid that President Biden laid out today?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we have expedited, as you &#8212; as you would &#8212; as we&#8217;ve noted from here, about 300 million dollars&#8217; worth of military and security assistance over the last couple of weeks.&nbsp; We continue to have channels to deliver military assistance.&nbsp; And so, we would continue to work to deliver it quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There have been military deliveries even in the last few days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, it has been rolling and you&#8217;re confident it will continue to be including these new elements that he laid out today?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We continue to have channels to do exactly that, yes.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.</p>



<p>And the President said, going back now to the long-range air defense systems, that he was working with Allies to acquire them.&nbsp; Can you tell us where they are and what the expectation is in terms of the timeline for getting those systems to Ukraine?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I can&#8217;t outline where they are because we&#8217;re going to keep those conversations private.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would note that a great deal of what we&#8217;re doing is augmenting the type of effective military assistance that we&#8217;re doing from the United States and working to prioritize equipment that they are trained on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we are discussing with a range of partners.&nbsp; When we say &#8220;Stinger&#8221; or &#8220;Javelins,&#8221; those are brands.&nbsp; There are different kinds of similar assistance or other types of assistance that different allies have around the world.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I want to go back to the MiGs quickly and just be crystal clear about what you&#8217;re saying.&nbsp; Because when I asked the President about this earlier, he said he&#8217;s not going to comment.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t say that it&#8217;s not an option.&nbsp; So &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we&#8217;ve spoken to it approximately 167 times.&nbsp; So, maybe he &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, here&#8217;s 168.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; (Laughter.)</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&#8217;s a growing &#8212; there&#8217;s a growing number of Republicans and Democrats who are supporting the U.S. striking a deal with Poland to send the MiGs.&nbsp; You have Elise Stefanik earlier today saying Ukraine “needs those MiGs.”&nbsp; You have Scalise saying, “Getting [those] MiGs in immediately is…critical.”&nbsp; There&#8217;s a growing chorus of voices saying that now is the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Has the President reconsidered his stance at all at this point?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No, because our military makes assessments, which &#8212; they put out that assessment last week and I would just echo that one part of the assessment is based on what equipment is effective in fighting this war.&nbsp; Anti-armor and air-defense systems, they are effectively defending the country.&nbsp; That is what we have provided additional assistance on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, they have several squa- &#8212; squadrons of mission-capable aircraft &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But they don’t think that’s enough, Jen.&nbsp; You heard President Zelenskyy &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; that are not being &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; very clearly say &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; Kristen, that are not &#8212; Kristen, that are not &#8212; Kristen, that are not being utilized.&nbsp; This is the assessment by our Defense Department.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Third, they&#8217;re also assessing that the transfer to Ukraine may be mistaken as escalatory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So this is how our Defense Department is assessing.&nbsp; They’re assessing also that it would not significantly change the effectiveness of the Ukrainian Air Force.&nbsp; And these are the types of risk ass- &#8212; risk assessments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We certainly understand.&nbsp; We share the passion, the anger, the horror at what we&#8217;re seeing.&nbsp; And that is why we are &#8212; we significantly increased the types of military assistance, the types of equipment that we know is effective and our Defense Department has determined is effective in fighting this war.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Zelenskyy ended his speech today by saying, “Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace.” Is President Biden satisfied that he&#8217;s meeting this leadership moment, given that we&#8217;re now three weeks into this war?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that President Zelenskyy also thanked the President for the role he&#8217;s played.&nbsp; And without President Biden, there would not be 30 countries around the world providing security and military assistance, NATO would not be as aligned as it is, we would not be unified in our implementation of the most crippling sanctions we&#8217;ve ever implemented against a foreign country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will continue to stand by President Zelenskyy’s side, the side of the Ukrainians and the brave and courageous Ukrainian people, and continue to build on the efforts that have been underway to date.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one more very quickly.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the wake of the Second Gentleman testing positive, has President Biden been tested today and has the Vice President been tested?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The &#8212; I can check on the Vice President. The President has not been.&nbsp; He was tested on Sunday.&nbsp; He was not a close contact, so we have not changed our testing mechanism.</p>



<p>Let me check on the Vice President.&nbsp; I know they put out some information last night.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll see if there&#8217;s an update.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Can you confirm that Switchblade drones were part of the package?&nbsp; And if so, do you consider that still defensive?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have more details beyond what was in our factsheet to confirm from here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And is the U.S. monitoring the hostage situation in Chernobyl?&nbsp; And did that come up in the call with Sullivan today?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We are definitely closely monitoring that situation.&nbsp; And I can check and see if that was a topic of discussion during their call.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, just lastly here, what does the administration make of the Russian proposal of Ukraine being a demilitarized Austrian-and-Swedish-type model?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; As a part of their 15-point discussion?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of &#8212; right.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Look, our focus is on supporting the Ukrainians in their efforts.&nbsp; Obviously, pursuing diplomacy is something we will always support.&nbsp; But as President Putin and the Russian military continues to take escalatory steps on the ground and take military action against civilians and innocent people, we think that is the biggest place where we need to see change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to ask if you&#8217;re &#8212; if you&#8217;re in a position today to say more about the contours of the President&#8217;s travel next week.&nbsp; What&#8217;s after Brussels, if anything?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything more for you at this point in time.&nbsp; We&#8217;re still finalizing the additional &#8212; any additional details.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that the Second Gentleman did test positive, does that raise concerns here about the state of &#8212; the situation of the country with BA.2 or any other variants that might be around?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It does not.&nbsp; Not from our health officials.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, back of the room.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I’ll go to the back in a second.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask just very briefly?&nbsp; Sarah Bloom Raskin &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; withdrew her nomination yesterday.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering if you could speak to that.&nbsp; And in particular, will you name a new no- &#8212; will the President name a new nominee soon for that post?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; He certainly will nominate a new person to serve &#8212; to nominate to that post.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been less than a day, so it may be a little bit more time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are certainly disappointed.&nbsp; Sarah Bloom Raskin remains one of the most highly qualified people to ever be nominated to this position.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s an important role, and he will nominate someone to fill the position.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you speak to how those final, sort of, days played out on that?&nbsp; Did &#8212; was there an attempt to get bipartisan support, or was Senator Manchin’s statement sort of seen as the decisive one when that came down?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I would say, as I said from this podium, it &#8212; there was continued efforts to seek bipartisan support and continue to support her candidacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, sorry, going back to the drones, is your position that the drones were assessed by the Defense Department to not be perceived as escalatory and to not be perceived as offensive weapons?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, I don&#8217;t have anything more to confirm beyond what was in the factsheet and the specifics in there.&nbsp; But defensive weapons is what we have provided.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;ll go to the back in a second.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The administration &#8212; including you, yesterday &#8212; have raised very dire warnings about what will happen &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; if this COVID money doesn&#8217;t come through.</p>



<p>President Biden held a bill signing yesterday &#8212; a very celebratory bill signing for a piece of legislation that that was stripped out of &#8212; that funding was stripped out of.&nbsp; Why didn&#8217;t the President mention it?&nbsp; And is he willing to expend political capital on this?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes, he is.&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; I would say that we have been working around the clock over the last few days, behind the scenes and publicly, to convey very clearly to elected officials across the country and the American people what the impacts will be.&nbsp; So, I would expect you&#8217;ll hear from him more soon about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on the meeting that Jake Sullivan &#8212; or the conversation that Jake Sullivan had with the Russian Security Council Secretary, can you say why that particular person was the one that the U.S. reached out to, why he was the one that Jake had a conversation with?&nbsp; Is there anything about his proximity to Putin or anything else that we should know?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s more to detail from here.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of questions on Russia.&nbsp; Obviously, the President calling Vladimir Putin personally a “war criminal” today.&nbsp; Are you going to be detailing whether orders to strike maternity wards, residential buildings, innocent children were coming from the very top?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say there&#8217;s a legal process where all of the data and information gathered will be fed into any international investigations.&nbsp; That&#8217;s led by the State Department.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think I spoke to this a few minutes earlier, where I conveyed the President was directly answering a question and speaking to his own passion in watching the barbaric actions of a brutal dictator invading a foreign country.&nbsp; But there is a legal process that is ongoing.&nbsp; The State Department has oversight over that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then the Chinese ambassador to the U.S. published a &#8212; an op-ed in the Washington Post.&nbsp; He said that threats against Chinese entities and businesses are unacceptable and, quote, “wielding the baton of sanctions at Chinese companies while seeking” Chinese &#8212; “China’s support and cooperation simply won&#8217;t work.”&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering if you have a response to that.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say that our &#8212; I don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve &#8212; that&#8217;s an accurate depiction of what we&#8217;ve been doing.&nbsp; What we&#8217;ve been conveying is that rhetorical support or the clear rhetorical lack of denunciation of what Russia is doing flies in the face of what China stands for, including basic principles of the U.N. Charter, including the basic principle of respect for sovereignty of nations.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s just a statement of fact.</p>



<p>Obviously, our objective and what we&#8217;ll watch closely is &#8212; and I don&#8217;t have an update on it from here &#8212; is, you know, any decision to provide additional support to Russia while they&#8217;re invading a foreign country.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Senator Chuck Grassley has put a hold on nomination of LA Mayor Eric Garcetti for U.S. Ambassadorship to India.&nbsp; Has the President spoken with his friend, senator?&nbsp; Or has the White House reached out to him to lift the hold?&nbsp; Or is the White House considering a new name for India?&nbsp; Is the absence of a U.S. Ambassador to India having an impact on your bilateral relationship?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, he can&#8217;t actually prevent a vote from moving forward on the floor.&nbsp; I mean, he can convey his opposition as is the right of any senator.&nbsp; But Mayor Garcetti is out of committee, and we&#8217;re hoping to see a vote on the Senate floor soon.&nbsp; And the President has confidence in Mayor Garcetti and believes he&#8217;ll be an excellent representative in India.</p>



<p>It is critical, of course, that we have confirmed leadership at all of our embassies, including India, and we urge the Senate to confirm him as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the middle of this war with Ukraine, how are the world&#8217;s largest and oldest democracies working together to bring peace in the region?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say, as you know, we remain in touch through a range of channels from our national security team with leaders in India, and continue to encourage leaders to work closely with us to &#8212; to stand up against President Putin&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; The wheat supplies from both Russia and Ukraine have been disrupted and are forecasted to be disrupted quite a bit going forward.&nbsp; Does the U.S. see the danger, as some have been talking about, about a breakdown, actually, of food supplies to large parts of the world, maybe starting with Africa?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; This is something we&#8217;re watching very closely.&nbsp; I have a little bit of information on this, so let me see if I can find it.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s see.</p>



<p>And we are concerned about how the wheat supply could impact different parts of the world, less the United States and more other parts of the world.&nbsp; There are also impacts we could see in the United States, including fertilizer and the production of fertilizer.&nbsp; Ukraine is a large producer of fertilizer.&nbsp; So, there are steps the Department of Agriculture has announced, and we are taking steps to work to address.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this is something &#8212; to go back to your original question &#8212; we are monitoring closely and we are, of course, continuing to evaluate what types of humanitarian assistance we can provide to address.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And just a quick one on another part of the world.&nbsp; Taiwan&#8217;s foreign minister said just this week &#8212; it might have been yesterday &#8212; that the U.S. is about to announce more arms sales to Taiwan.&nbsp; Do you have anything on that?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to predict, confirm, or read out on that.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to check with our Defense Department.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; So, the President has obviously sanctioned a lot of Russian oligarchs.&nbsp; I wonder about some of the laws &#8212; our laws that enable this sort of international kleptocracy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, the President&#8217;s been outspoken about his belief that America&#8217;s tax code should be more fair, that it should be enforced better.&nbsp; And I wonder if the President has thought about or has had conversations with people on the Hill about possible legislation that would change some of these laws, make real estate transactions more transparent, require companies and trust to be registered to people by their actual name, prevent Americans from using offshore banks as tax havens.&nbsp; Any of that under consideration?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; A number of those he&#8217;s expressed support for in the past.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to check with our economic team and see if any of those are under discussion.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But no sense that those talks have picked up in the last few weeks?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t have an update on it.</p>



<p>Go ahead, Karen.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to get back to Jake Sullivan&#8217;s call: You noted when you were first talking about it that this was the most senior conversation between the U.S. and Russia since Secretary Blinken&#8217;s last conversation with Lavrov.&nbsp; So, why now?&nbsp; Why today?&nbsp; Has something changed that&#8217;s given the administration any reason to think this could produce some progress &#8212; a call like this?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t put that much optimism in it.&nbsp; I would say that there have been ongoing direct and indirect conversations with the Russians.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not that it stopped at any point.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve &#8212; they&#8217;ve &#8212; those have happened through our Ambassador, and it just felt like the appropriate time for our National Security Advisor to have a discussion and directly convey that there will be additional consequences should things proceed, including if there is a use of chemical weapons.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess, to ask you the inverse then &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; would there be any increasing concerns that prompted that call today?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would say that, you know, diplomatic conversations and talks &#8212; there isn&#8217;t always a magic reason why they happen in a particular moment.&nbsp; And this was &#8212; just felt like the appropriate time for them, for us to engage at that level.</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp; I have to wrap up in a second here, but go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; You put out a list of all of the military equipment &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; included in that $400 million &#8212; $800 million &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; that&#8217;s being provided to Ukraine.&nbsp; Among those items &#8212; let me read them to you: 100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns, and 400 shotguns.&nbsp; Are you saying those items are not offensive weapons?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; They&#8217;re weapons that help the Ukrainian people fight against an invasion by a foreign country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They can be used offensively, can they not?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, they are weapons.&nbsp; What I&#8217;m talking about is weapons that can be used to fight &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer is &#8220;yes.&#8221;&nbsp; The answer is &#8220;yes.&#8221;&nbsp; I mean, although you don&#8217;t want to say it, that answer to that question is &#8220;yes.&#8221;&nbsp; And so, obviously, you&#8217;re trying to make this distinction between offensive and defensive weapons &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, what we’re talking about &#8212; let me finish.&nbsp; Let me finish.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, let me finish, because I give you my point &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Let me finish my answer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; you make &#8212; no, you weren’t &#8212; no, I was finishing a point, and then you can respond to my point.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay, go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; You&#8217;re making this distinction between offensive and defensive weapons.&nbsp; Anybody that looks at that list of weapons that I just mentioned, they would say, clearly, they&#8217;re offensive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a Ukrainian military officer or someone who is enlisted has one of these weapons, they can take out a Russian military official of some sort with these weapons.&nbsp; They&#8217;re offensive in nature.&nbsp; So, why not provide more offensive weapons like this to the Ukrainian military?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, first of all, we are providing a range of rifles, et cetera.&nbsp; There is a difference between a plane and planes and massive military systems &#8212; I think anybody would recognize this &#8212; and what we&#8217;re talking about, which is giving rifles and pistols to many of them farmers and people living in countrysides to defend themselves.&nbsp; I think there&#8217;s a difference that most people recognize.</p>



<p>Thank you, everyone, so much.&nbsp; Have a nice day.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, you promised the back of the room today.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I will get to you tomorrow.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry, I have to wrap up.&nbsp; I apologize.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&#8217;s going to be another kerfuffle, Jen.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No more kerfuffles!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">East Room</p>



<p>2:09 P.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Please, thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you, thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I should be clapping for all of you.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zahara, do I have permission to proceed?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, first of all, as I was standing there listening, I should say that &#8212; thank all of you, everyone in this room.&nbsp; We didn&#8217;t change the law; we set out &#8212; I remember some of you way back when I first wrote this legislation &#8212; to change the culture &#8212; to change the culture.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; For real.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it&#8217;s great to be with you all.&nbsp; And, Ruth, it’s been an honor to stand with you through these years.&nbsp; And she was a serious victim of violence &#8212; left for dead, basically &#8212; before this law was written.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you make me think of the women who were willing to come and testify before the whole world when I first started those hearings.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t viewed, even among the advocacy groups, as necessarily a particularly positive thing to do.&nbsp; It was &#8212; because &#8212; anyway, you know.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for your courage, for being a hero, sharing your powerful voice, and standing up for thousands of women.&nbsp; And that could be said about most of you in this room.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to thank the members of the Senate and the House, members of my Cabinet for all you&#8217;ve done.&nbsp; The idea that this took five years to reauthorize &#8212; I was out of office those years. &#8212; (laughter and applause) &#8212; and it drove me crazy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I &#8212; that&#8217;s not why it didn&#8217;t happen, but it drove me crazy.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; It drove me crazy, the rationale for why we weren&#8217;t &#8212; anyway.&nbsp; I won&#8217;t get into that.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I know some of you think maybe I should be out of office for another four years.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the point is, it’s wonderful to see so many brave survivors and dedicated advocates and &#8212; and, truly, old friends &#8212; so many who have worked so hard to modernize the Violence Against Women Act to make it stronger and make sure that it endures.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the reason we’ve been able to do so much, make so much progress in the past 20 years is because of all of you.&nbsp; And I know some of you aren&#8217;t even 28 years old, so it doesn&#8217;t count for you guys.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But all kidding aside, it really does &#8212; again, I keep coming back to you &#8212; you changed the culture, not just the law.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I want to thank the bipartisan members of Congress who helped get this latest reauthorization done.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Dianne &#8212; Dianne Feinstein, Joni Ernst, Lisa Murkowski.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the House &#8212; in the House of Representatives, nobody worked harder than Sheila Jackson Lee, and &#8212; and I thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I learned a long time ago: When Sheila wants something, just say yes.&nbsp; It saves time.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Jerry Nadler, a great friend and a great congressman.&nbsp; And Brian Fitzpatrick &#8212; Brian, thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, thank you for coming together and never giving up.&nbsp; You know, the fact is that it really wasn’t so long ago this country didn&#8217;t want to talk about violence against women, let alone as being a national epidemic, something the government had to address.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a society, we literally looked away.&nbsp; We looked away.&nbsp; In many places, it wasn’t a crime.&nbsp; And I don&#8217;t recall &#8212; I don&#8217;t recall how many times I was told in the prelude to writing the legislation that it&#8217;s a &#8220;family affair.&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;You don&#8217;t understand, Biden.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a family affair.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I began, along with others, to pursue this legislation to change this &#8212; this issue, we were told that we would literally be responsible for the &#8220;disintegration&#8221; of American families in the major press.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t just the wackos; it was in the mainstream press.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we talked about creating shelters to give survivors a way out because so many don&#8217;t have a way out, and their children &#8212; by the way, the vast majority of children on the street with their mothers are there because she&#8217;s a victim of domestic violence.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And here&#8217;s what they said, here&#8217;s what they wrote: They said these shelters &#8212; providing shelter was nothing more than &#8220;indoctrination centers&#8221; for women&#8217;s liberation issues.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I can get you the articles.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a fact.&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Not a joke.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And calling the police meant having to stand in front of your abuser &#8212; your significant other, your husband, whomever &#8212; and say, &#8220;He did it.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I used to say, when I&#8217;d get heat on this, when I spoke &#8212; I remember making a speech to the Chamber of Commerce, and someone said, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re going overboard here.&#8221;&nbsp; I said, &#8220;Let me ask you, Jack.&#8221;&nbsp; I said, &#8220;If you had a 320-pound guy who could bench 400 pounds standing in front of you and beat the &#8212; smacked you, are you going to say he did it?&nbsp; Because you know he&#8217;s going to come back.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking, few &#8212; there were very few police departments that had trained personnel.&nbsp; I mean very few.&nbsp; I &#8212; I&#8217;m sure there were some, I just can&#8217;t remember any of them.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, I really mean it.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as a matter of fact, I can’t &#8212; I don&#8217;t think there were any Special Victims Units in most of the police departments around the country before this legislation was written.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now there&#8217;s programs that are on TV for the last 25, 30 years.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; No, but I really mean it.&nbsp; It mattered.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what I mean about changing the culture.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, and there were too few places you could go for advice or for help.&nbsp; Where would you go?&nbsp; And how many times &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember the biggest fights I had were the second time around with universities &#8212; with universities.&nbsp; Where do you show up?&nbsp; Where do you report this?&nbsp; &#8220;Well, we don&#8217;t want to…&#8221;&nbsp; I mean major universities &#8212; not Podunk universities.&nbsp; Major universities.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took time to change the culture, and you did it.&nbsp; You did it.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no national hotline.&nbsp; I remember going &#8212; all kidding aside &#8212; there have been millions of women who&#8217;ve hit that hotline button.&nbsp; You know, all the brave guys I talk to, they say, &#8220;Biden, you&#8217;re overdoing this.&#8221;&nbsp; And I&#8217;d say, &#8220;Tell me &#8212; tell you what: If somebody who was twice your size, beating the living crap out of you and you were in the same apartment with them, how do you go and pick up the phone and call for help?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Women would hide and say, &#8220;I can&#8217;t &#8212; I can&#8217;t say where I am.&nbsp; I &#8212; I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; Help me.&nbsp; Help me.&#8221;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#8217;s how we got Microsoft and others in this &#8212; in this fight with us, to help us physically locate so the police could pick up where that call was coming from.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the background when I first wrote the Violence Against Women Act in 1990 to provide more protection against domestic violence, stalking, sexual assault; to support survivors and help them find ways out of their abusive situations.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>They’d say, &#8220;Why didn’t &#8212; why didn’t she leave?&#8221;&nbsp; Well, she didn’t leave.&nbsp; She had no place to go, and she had two kids with her.&nbsp; No money.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; No family to go to.&nbsp; Leave?<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;ve been asked, time to time, was there &#8212; the reason, I guess, I got a little overwrought about this legislation early on &#8212; not that I ever get overwrought.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But &#8212; and I &#8212; literally, the most oft-asked questions for the first three years of the act was, &#8220;Well, why are you so passionate about this?&nbsp; Was your mother a victim of domestic violence?&nbsp; Was your sister or your wife?&nbsp; Were they &#8212; were they victims?&#8221;&nbsp; I swear to God.&nbsp; That was the most oft-asked question of me.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I&#8217;d say, &#8220;No, that&#8217;s not the answer.&#8221;&nbsp; I happened to be raised by a gentle, decent man, who taught all of his children &#8212; and I mean this from the bottom of my heart &#8212; Lisa, you know this; you knew my dad.&nbsp; My dad would say the greatest sin of all that anyone could commit was the abuse of power, and the cardinal sin was for a man to raise his hand to a woman or a child.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That’s what this law has always been about: the abuse of power.&nbsp; Whether it ends in a rape or just the physical be- &#8212; it&#8217;s about the abuse of power. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, I believed, as many of you in this room did, that &#8212; that I believe that too.&nbsp; And the only way we could change the culture was by shining an ugly, bright light on it and speaking its name.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>You can make all the speeches you wanted, but until those women had the courage &#8212; and I remember &#8212; I remember in a backroom hold and they said, &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be okay.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to be okay.&#8221;&nbsp; Can you imagine being among the first to stand before the whole damn world and millions of people hear you recite how you were abused?<br>&nbsp;<br>It took enormous courage.&nbsp; And at the time, the Majority Leader may remember, we both got criticized for wanting to make it public.&nbsp; &#8220;We don’t want to do that.&nbsp; We don’t want to do that.&#8221;&nbsp; That’s why we held public hearings for this law when there were senators and others who said it was too salacious for this to be public, for people to see.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, we &#8212; but I believed &#8212; and a lot of us did &#8212; that we had to let America know what was going on.&nbsp; Take the blinders off.&nbsp; Make them look at it square in the eye.&nbsp; All the ugly side of it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Because I believed, as all of you did, that Americans are basically decent and honorable people.&nbsp; But they didn’t want to get involved.&nbsp; Didn’t want to get involved.<br>&nbsp;<br>How many times have you been in a crowded airport or in a circumstance where you see a man not physically beating but abusing a woman &#8212; and you just say, &#8220;You know, I don’t want to hear that.&nbsp; I don’t want to &#8212; I don’t know what to do.&#8221;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Well, I believe that if they could see the truth as to what was going on, we could begin slowly to make change.&nbsp; And that’s exactly what you all did and that’s what happened.<br>&nbsp;<br>This law broke the dam of congressional resistance and cultural resistance.&nbsp; And it brought this hidden epidemic out of the shadows.&nbsp; You know, its introduction &#8212; it introduced our nation to so many brave survivors who those stories changed the way America saw the issue.&nbsp; I mean, in the literal sense, it&#8217;s hard to believe &#8212; even when I go back and think of when &#8212; how it started and where it was.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As a practical matter, things began to shift &#8212; the legal and social burdens &#8212; away from survivors and onto perpetrators and where they belonged.&nbsp; It made addressing general &#8212; excuse me &#8212; gender violence a shared priority with a determined, coordinated response.&nbsp; It created a hotline, as I said, for millions of women who have used the hotline.&nbsp; And again, I&#8217;ll never forget being told the first time &#8212; I said, &#8220;What did you do?&#8221;&nbsp; She said, &#8220;I got behind the drapes and I held the phone.&nbsp; And I prayed to God &#8212; prayed to God &#8212; don’t let him hear this.&nbsp; Pray God.&nbsp; Pray God.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>It supported shelters and rape crisis centers, housing and legal assistance, creating lifesaving options for women and children all across the country.&nbsp; And it helped train police officers, advocates, prosecutors, judges, court personnel to make the entire justice system fair and more responsive to the needs of survivors.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I’ll never forget, Chris, I went to the family court when I was writing this &#8212; and the family court in my state is like many of yours.&nbsp; And I watched &#8212; because I was told this would happen &#8212; I watched a woman come up to the desk and say, &#8220;I want to report that my husband is beating me up.&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;Well, why don’t you have a seat over there.&#8221;&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp; Go back and check your family courts back in the day.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#8217;s what happened.&nbsp; &#8220;That’s okay.&nbsp; You go over here.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll get to that.&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;No, no, I &#8212; I need help now.&nbsp; Now.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, the law has saved lives.&nbsp; It&#8217;s helped women rebuild their lives.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The hardest thing to get done was arrest on information.&nbsp; Because what used to happen is a cop may be in the street and see a husband or a boyfriend or a man &#8212; anyone &#8212; smack his wife.&nbsp; And he&#8217;d come over and say, &#8220;Do you want to bring charges?&#8221;&nbsp; What the hell is she going to say? &nbsp;&#8220;Yeah, I want to bring…&#8221;&nbsp; We got the law changed to say the cop can arrest on information.&nbsp; He saw it happen.&nbsp; He saw it happen.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And all of these bad &#8212; these tough guys.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>Even in 1994, we knew that there was much more we had to do &#8212; you know, that it was only the beginning.&nbsp; That’s why, because of all of you in this room, every time we’ve reauthorized this law, it&#8217;s been improved.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not like we didn’t know we wanted to do these other things in the beginning.&nbsp; It&#8217;s we did as much as we could and keep trying to add to it.&nbsp; You remember.&nbsp; You sat at my desk &#8212; a lot of time with me on this.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Broadening from domestic violence to include stalking and sexual assault in 2000. &nbsp;That was the change made.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Expanding access to services for immigrants and communities of color in 2005. &nbsp;That was a change.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Restoring jurisdiction of Tribal courts &#8212; (applause) &#8212; over non-Native domestic violence offenders who abuse women in Indian Country. &nbsp;We did that in 2013.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Extending protections to everyone, regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity, in 2013.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I&#8217;m sorry to go on, but you all should &#8212; the country owes you &#8212; all of you.&nbsp; I really mean it.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; The law kept growing stronger.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not like we didn’t know in 2005 we should be dealing with the things we dealt with in 2013.&nbsp; It was getting it done.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Each link in the chain that we&#8217;re building made a difference &#8212; makes a difference.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Yesterday, I signed the Bipartisan Government Funding Bill.&nbsp; Thank you very much for that.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And, consequentially, we forged the next link in the chain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only &#8212; not only did we reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act through 2027 &#8212; and I have to wonder why the hell we can’t reauthorize it.&nbsp; It&#8217;s like the Voting Rights Act.&nbsp; I thought we had won when I got Strom Thurmond to vote for it and extend it for 25 years, and then the Court came along.&nbsp; But at any rate, that’s another issue.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>But look, you know, I don&#8217;t &#8212; just think about this.&nbsp; If this affected manhood &#8212; men &#8212; I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;d have a problem, you know, doing it for even longer, making it permanent.&nbsp; But at any rate, that&#8217;s a different thing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Look, we delivered more help to survivors in rural areas &#8212; we understand &#8212; and in underserved communities for a simple reason: There is no place to go.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, whether it&#8217;s Arizona or whether it&#8217;s Michigan, wherever it is, you&#8217;re in a rural area, you call, you get help, and you do get help, and then they leave.&nbsp; And the next nearest &#8212; and the next nearest town is 20 miles.&nbsp; How long does it take for the cop to get there?<br>&nbsp;<br>Tribal courts will now be able to exercise jurisdiction over non-Native perpetrators of sexual assault, child abuse, sex trafficking, and so much more.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>You have all added new services and resources for folks in most underserved communities &#8212; the LGBTQ community, survivors of those rural communities &#8212; providing more support and legal services, for law enforcement to get training they need to help handle the trauma of &#8212; survivors are experiencing.<br>&nbsp;<br>And, by the way, it&#8217;s not a criticism of the police.&nbsp; We &#8212; for all the mistakes police make and all the things they do wrong &#8212; we expect them to be everything from a counselor to a expert on sexual violence to an expert on all these things.&nbsp; But, you know, these are vast majority people with, you know, degrees that are two-year degrees after school.&nbsp; I mean, they’re the smart, but they &#8212; I mean, we expect them to be psychologists; we expect them to be everything.<br>&nbsp;<br>So we established a new civil rights &#8212; a new civil rights cause of action for those whose intimate images were shared on the public screen.&nbsp; How many times have you heard &#8212; I’ll bet everybody knows somebody somewhere along the line that in an intimate relationship, what happened was the guy takes a revealing picture of his naked friend, or whatever, in a compromising position, and then literally, in a sense, blackmails or mortifies that person &#8212; sends it out, put it online.<br>&nbsp;<br>We’re giving survivors real resources against abuse now.&nbsp; Ex-partners and stalkers who seek to humiliate and hurt them.<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;ve created &#8212; you created new programs to help end the backlog of the rape kits.&nbsp; And those rape kits, by the way, I don&#8217;t know &#8212; you ought to go to your major cities, those of you in the House and Senate &#8212; this group probably has &#8212; which I have done.&nbsp; And this backlog is so significant.&nbsp; You could solve literally a significant portion of &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Look, the only thing I learned that’s worse than &#8212; for a woman &#8212; worse than a woman who is abused or raped and says, “It&#8217;s Charlie who did it,” and no one believes her &#8212; him against her.&nbsp; And when &#8212; you can take a look.&nbsp; If you take a look at those rape kits and you went through them all, you could identify and arrest probably 40, 50 percent of the rapists in America.&nbsp; They&#8217;re all there.&nbsp; Their DNAs are there.&nbsp; It’s all in line.&nbsp; And run it against the whole panoply.&nbsp; Very few rapists rape only once.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, look, that &#8212; you know, there&#8217;s a lot that goes unprocessed.&nbsp; And we have to make sure survivors get compensation, and if there have been delays in their cases &#8212; you know, we&#8217;ve made improvements in the National Criminal Background Check System to help states investigate and prosecute cases when abuses &#8212; when abusers who are barred from purchasing firearms attempt to do so.&nbsp; That, we’ve done federally.&nbsp; Quite frankly, this held &#8212; that&#8217;s one of the things that held up this bill for much too long.&nbsp; Much too long.<br>&nbsp;<br>Those are just a few of the ways we’ve strengthened &#8212; you, not we &#8212; you’ve strengthened the law.&nbsp; Because I just came on the &#8212; back on the &#8212; on the range again.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I haven’t been &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>But look, it comes on top of the work we&#8217;ve done together over the last years to make progress.&nbsp; We know the pandemic only exacerbated instances of domestic violence and sexual violence.&nbsp; It&#8217;s shot up like a Roman candle.<br>&nbsp;<br>And through the American Rescue Plan, the administration<br>directed $1 billion in supplemental funding for domestic violence and sexual assault services &#8212; (applause) &#8212; because they’re badly needed.<br>&nbsp;<br>And we’ve worked with local public housing authorities to make sure that survivors trapped in a bad situation can find safe new housing options in public housing.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Because they don’t have (inaudible) to go.&nbsp; You.<br>&nbsp;<br>And we also made landmark reforms in military justice to help end the epidemic of sexual violence and harassment in our armed forces &#8212; (applause) &#8212; fundamentally changing how the military investigates, prosecutes sexual assault, domestic violence, and other related crimes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thank you, Kirsten Gillibrand.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you, Jackie Speier.&nbsp; Is Jackie here?&nbsp; Stand up, please.&nbsp; Stand up.&nbsp; You did an incredible job.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Earlier this month, I signed a bar- &#8212; bipartisan bill that ends what we know as forced arbitration.&nbsp; That&#8217;s wonderful, isn’t it?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; No, no, but I mean the small print to sign a contract, and the small print says you can&#8217;t do anything if your boss, male or female &#8212; if you end up getting abused and if you end up doing something &#8212; you know, you can&#8217;t &#8212; you have to do it internally.&nbsp; No more.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; No more.&nbsp; Really.<br>&nbsp;<br>And 80 percent of the people who sign those don&#8217;t even know what&#8217;s in the &#8212; in the contract.<br>&nbsp;<br>The mechanism has prevented too many survivors of abuse and harassment in the workplace from having the choice to get their day in court.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Look, these are just a few of the steps you&#8217;ve all taken and how much you&#8217;ve improved this legislation.&nbsp; But as everyone in this room knows, this work is not going to stop.&nbsp; It never stops.<br>&nbsp;<br>Today, one year since a gunman killed eight people in Atlanta, six of whom were women of Asian descent, these horrific murders are a reminder that we still have work to do to put an end to misogyny and racism and all forms of hate we have.<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;re never going to get it all done, but we can&#8217;t ever stop trying.&nbsp; As long as there are women in this country and around the world who live in fear of violence, there&#8217;s more we have to do to fulfill this sacred commitment.&nbsp; No one &#8212; no one, regardless of gender or sexual orientation, should experience abuse.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; And if they do, they should have the services and support they need to get through it.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re not going to rest.<br>&nbsp;<br>But in the meantime, all of you should be enormously proud of what you&#8217;ve accomplished.&nbsp; This reauthorization is testament to the power of your voices and your tireless dedication to changing things for the better.<br>&nbsp;<br>And one last thing: Some of you in here helped me work on the International Violence Against Women Act.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I&#8217;m coming back.&nbsp; Seriously.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I&#8217;ll tell you a very short concluding story.<br>&nbsp;<br>When I was Vice President &#8212; I can&#8217;t remember, probably the seventh year in or thereabouts &#8212; I was in India, and I met &#8212; at the home where Mahatma Gandhi was able to be hidden for a long while.&nbsp; And &#8212; and &#8212; and I met with two of the daughters of India&#8217;s most serious liberators.&nbsp; And, you know, I thought they were going to ask me questions about, you know, U.S.-India relations.&nbsp; They said, “Can you help us write a Violence Against Women Act?”&nbsp; Not a joke.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Just by some of you speaking out &#8212; Republicans and Democrats &#8212; just by your speaking out about how we abhor those nations that do, in fact, call for &#8212; and go through the list &#8212; it’s changing behaviors.&nbsp; I think we have to even be stronger than that, but that’s another &#8212; that’s another boring speech.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>But, look, let’s keep going.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you all.&nbsp; May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>2:34 P.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;</p>
