<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>9:38 A.M. EDT</p>



<p>MR MUNOZ:&nbsp; Hey, everybody.&nbsp; Thank you for joining today&#8217;s call to preview the President&#8217;s Pride event today and the new executive order that he will be signing.&nbsp; Ahead of this call, you should have received an embargoed factsheet &#8212; until 12:00 p.m.</p>



<p>This call will be attributable to “senior administration officials.”&nbsp; On today&#8217;s call, we have [senior administration official] and [senior administration official].</p>



<p>With that, I will kick it to [senior administration official].&nbsp;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Good morning, everyone.&nbsp; It&#8217;s good to be talking with you.&nbsp; Again, my name is [senior administration official].&nbsp; As Kevin said, I&#8217;m [redacted] &#8212; that includes our work to advance LGBTQI+ equality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, in celebration of Pride Month, the President will host a White House reception in the East Room.&nbsp; He&#8217;ll be joined by the Vice President, the First Lady, the Second Gentleman, Secretary Buttigieg, Secretary Haaland, and hundreds of LGBTQI+ leaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President has invited members of Congress, including the leaders of the Equality Caucus; out and proud appointees in his administration; LGBTQI+ state and local elected leaders; and grassroots advocates who have been leading the work in the states to fight back against the onslaught of hateful anti-LGBTQI+ legislation that we&#8217;re seeing in the states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year we&#8217;ve seen over 300 anti-LGBTQI+ laws introduced in state legislatures, and many of them specifically target transgender children and their parents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most importantly, the President is bringing LGBTQI+ kids and families from across the country who have been personally impacted by these discriminatory bills to the White House &#8212; kids from Texas and Florida who have seen their rights under attack, who have had to stand up to their governors and their state lawmakers as they advance discriminatory legislation.</p>



<p>Today, the President will be introduced, in fact, by Javier Gomez, an inspiring 18-year-old Floridian who just graduated from high school and helped to organize the statewide student walkouts over the “Don&#8217;t Say Gay” bill that bans teachers from discussing LGBTQI+ people and families.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These attendees represent the best of America.&nbsp; They are diverse, passionate advocates who are fighting to ensure that the promise of freedom and equality is made real for all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can expect the President today to celebrate the historic progress of his administration.&nbsp; For example, issuing a day one executive order to strengthen protections for LGBTQI+ Americans and advancing full equality, ensuring that in healthcare, housing, education, employment, and more areas, that LGBTQI+ people have their rights respected; also reversing the ban on transgender service members; imposing services &#8212; I’m sorry, improving services for transgender Americans, including with new “X” gender markers on passports; and appointing a historic member of LGBTQI+ public servants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President is also going to, again, forcefully condemn the discriminatory attacks on the LGBTQI+ children and families that we&#8217;re seeing all across the country.&nbsp; He will talk about how these bills are worsening the mental health crisis that LGBTQI+ youth are facing, putting them at greater risk of suicide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>President Biden always stands up to bullies.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what these extreme MAGA laws and policies do &#8212; they bully kids.&nbsp; Hateful, discriminatory laws that target children are out of line with where the American people are.&nbsp; And President Biden is going to use his executive authority to protect kids and families.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At today&#8217;s event, the President will sign an executive order on advancing equality for LGBTQI+ individuals.&nbsp; That executive order will take historic steps to support LGBTQI+ people, especially children and families.</p>



<p>LGBTQI+ children face stark disparities.&nbsp; Nearly half of them said that they &#8212; nearly half of LGBTQI+ youth said that they seriously considered committing suicide last year.&nbsp; Nearly 40 percent of all youth experiencing homelessness are LGBTQI+.&nbsp; One in five LGBTQ- &#8212;</p>



<p>(Call drops.)</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Just checking.&nbsp; Sorry, we had some sound challenges.&nbsp; [Senior administration official], can you &#8212; can you hear us?&nbsp;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yes, I can hear you now.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; All right, we&#8217;re back. Thanks, guys.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Did folks hear what I was saying before?&nbsp; I&#8217;m unclear.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah?&nbsp; We’re good?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; So let’s just start where you were.&nbsp; All right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; The President&#8217;s executive order will protect LGBTQI+ youth from so-called “conversion therapy,” a dangerous and discredited practice that increases the risk of youth suicide and has been condemned by every major medical association.</p>



<p>President Biden specifically is charging HHS with leading an initiative to reduce the risk of youth exposure to this dangerous practice, directing the Secretary of State to promote an end to conversion therapy around the world, and encouraging the Federal Trade Commission to consider whether conversion therapy constitutes an unfair or deceptive act or practice and whether to issue consumer warnings on notices about it.</p>



<p>The President&#8217;s executive order will also address the LGBTQI+ youth mental health crisis and help prevent LGBTQI+ suicide by expanding access to suicide prevention resources that meet the needs of LGBTQI+ youth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President&#8217;s EO will also launch a new initiative to address the discrimination that children and parents face in the foster care system.&nbsp; LGBTQI+ children are over represented in the foster care &#8212; in foster care.&nbsp; And LGBTQI+ parents, who play a vital and outsized role in ensuring that children in foster care are adopted by loving families, continue to face barriers and biases as they form a family.</p>



<p>And the President&#8217;s executive order will strengthen protections for LGBTQI+ older Americans who face high rates of poverty, discrimination, and isolation.&nbsp; He is charging HHS with developing a new bill of rights for LGBTQI+ seniors.</p>



<p>The order will also strengthen federal data collection on sexual orientation and gender identity, address LGBTQI+ homelessness and housing insecurity, and protect healthcare access for LGBTQI+ youth and families.</p>



<p>You know, taken together these are important new actions that will improve the health, wellbeing, and safety of countless families across the country.&nbsp; And they will send a powerful signal from the President of the United States to LGBTQI kids across the country who may be feeling scared and hopeless that their President has their back.</p>



<p>With that, I&#8217;ll hand it (inaudible) my colleague Kevin to moderate a few questions.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Thank you, everybody, for joining.&nbsp; We have time for a few questions.</p>



<p>First, let&#8217;s go to Chris Johnson at the Washington Blade.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, thanks for hosting this call.&nbsp; Two questions, really.&nbsp; The &#8212; this executive order seems to be challenging a number of these state laws that are already in place, you know, against LGBTQ youth.&nbsp; What kind of response are you anticipating from them on this executive order once Biden signs that?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; We don’t &#8212; we don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; I mean, but the focus is not really on what their response will be.&nbsp; We&#8217;re &#8212; what we&#8217;re focused on is responding to the, frankly, un-American policies that they’re pushing through state legislatures.&nbsp; They&#8217;re going after kids; they&#8217;re going after families just because of who they are.</p>



<p>And the President has said repeatedly that he will stand with LGBTQI youth and families and people across the country.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what this executive order is going to do.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to send that message.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to direct the full force of the federal government to provide resources and support for families so that while they&#8217;re under attack by the state, they know that we&#8217;re on their side and we&#8217;re providing resources to help them.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Thanks, Chris.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, let&#8217;s go to Catherine Lucey at the Wall Street Journal.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey there.&nbsp; Thanks for doing the call.&nbsp; Can you guys go over at all what the cost is of these proposals, these various initiatives and what the funding stream is?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; These are actions that the President can take within his existing authority and within the existing budgets of agencies.&nbsp; So, we are using existing resources to prioritize responding to these anti-LGBT, anti-family state laws.&nbsp; We&#8217;re using existing resources to support families across the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That said, I also want to note that the President&#8217;s budget proposal for FY23 includes a number of additional asks for funding to support improved access to healthcare, education, mental healthcare in particular, and a whole host of other resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So the President is really working on multiple fronts here to support LGBT youth and families.&nbsp; This executive order can go into effect right away.&nbsp; It does not depend on any additional congressional appropriations.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Eugene Daniels at Politico.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey there.&nbsp; Can you guys hear me?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Yup.&nbsp; Thank you, Eugene.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thanks for doing this.&nbsp; One of the things that I constantly hear from advocates in this space is the &#8212; about the Equality Act.&nbsp; And, you know, they&#8217;ve seen how the President pushed and continued to push for Build Back Better at one point, the Infrastructure Law, even voting rights legislation, and they haven&#8217;t seen &#8212; felt like they&#8217;ve seen the exact same push for the Equality Act.&nbsp; So I guess I&#8217;m just curious: Is this going to renew the calls from the President to &#8212; for Congress to work on and pass the Equality Act and send it to his desk?</p>



<p><a>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; The President is a strong supporter of the Equality Act, and he has not wavered in that.&nbsp; He continues to call on Congress to pass the Equality Act.&nbsp; You heard him renew that call during the State of the Union Address &#8212; the biggest stage that we have.</a></p>



<p>You know, any assertion that he hasn&#8217;t been full-throated on that is just completely at odds with the fact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the President today will reiterate the need to sign this legislation into law.&nbsp; He is ready for it.&nbsp; He wants Congress to send it to his desk so he can sign it into law.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Next, let&#8217;s go to Orion Rummler at 19th News.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much, Kevin.&nbsp; Two questions for you all: How would HHS, the Biden administration enforce guidance if federally funded programs cannot offer conversion therapy on this?&nbsp; And when would HHS be expected to put out or clarify guidance on this?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And also, I have a question on gender-affirming care.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; The executive order directs HHS to use all of its resources, as this is part of a, you know, whole-of-government, full-court press against this discredited and harmful practice of conversion therapy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President and the White House cannot direct the exercise of the enforcement power.&nbsp; That is up to, you know, teams of lawyers who carefully consider the facts and apply the law to the facts of any particular situation.&nbsp; And they have to continue to do that work.</p>



<p>We are appropriately resourcing them &#8212; again, seeking more funding from Congress to support that (inaudible).&nbsp;</p>



<p>This executive order does direct them to explore how to beat back this discredited practice of conversion therapy.<br><br>So, it’s &#8212; there’s an important distinction there about the role of the President and the White House and the enforcement power.&nbsp; In this administration, it’s very important for the enforcement power to be exercised independently by the agencies.<br><br>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; And, Orion, your second question?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Can you all hear me?<br><br>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Yep.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; So, for charging HHS to work with states to promote expanded access to gender-affirming care, how can this care be promoted in states that are actively trying to ban it?&nbsp; Is &#8212; like, what would promoting it do?</p>



<p><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Well, I mean, in states that are &#8212; that are trying to ban it or that are, you know, trying to criminalize or promote investigations against families for seeking the support that their children need, the administration is taking &#8212; has taken a number of steps.<br><br>Already put out guid- &#8212; we&#8217;ve already put out guidance through HHS about civil rights protections and making clear that the denial of medical care based on someone&#8217;s gender identity is discriminatory, and have invited the members of the public to file complaints with the Office of Civil Rights.&nbsp; So, that has already happened.&nbsp; That is already underway.<br><br>I think also &#8212; so, providing that guidance, providing resources, making clear the state of the law is certainly something that can happen in these states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also important to emphasize that some states, you know, like Colorado, for example, are doing the right thing and are expanding access to gender-affirming care.<br><br>The President&#8217;s executive order charges HHS with working with states that want to advance health equity by supporting them in asse- &#8212; accessing that care.&nbsp; So, that&#8217;s just an important part of this to not lose sight of.<br><br>We are seeing a lot of state-level attacks.&nbsp; And, you know, that&#8217;s something we are standing with LGBT families in responding to.&nbsp; It&#8217;s also important to continue to push for expanding care where there are state legislators who are willing and ready partners.</p>



<p><br>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; All right, a couple more questions.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Sandhya Raman at Roll Call.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks for doing this.&nbsp; So, my question was: Would the executive order include any of the changes to 1557 under HHS that we&#8217;ve been expecting?&nbsp; Or would the final rule for that be completely separate, related to the non-discrimination protections?&nbsp; And if it&#8217;s not connected, would we expect that soon, since they deal with similar topics?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; This executive order does not direct- &#8212; does not include the release of the rule that you&#8217;re describing &#8212; the 1557 rule.&nbsp; The administration is working hard on the 1557 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would protect patients from discrimination.&nbsp; That continues to be a priority.<br><br>It is a big rule.&nbsp; You know, and these rules are complicated, and it&#8217;s important to get it right.&nbsp; So I don&#8217;t have a timing update for you at this time beyond what we&#8217;ve already shared.&nbsp; But it continues to be a priority for us.</p>



<p><br>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; All right, last question.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Trudy Ring at The Advocate.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I know this is outside the scope of the executive order, but in states that have enacted anti-LGBTQ policies &#8212; like the bans on gender-affirming care or the, you know, investigations &#8212; with the lawsuits that have been brought against them, does the administration plan to possibly file statements of interest in those suits?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; The administration is already doing this all over the country.&nbsp; The Justice Department has issued statements of interest, briefs in multiple cases that are brought by plaintiffs challenging these unjust laws.&nbsp; That work we expect to continue.<br><br>Again, those decisions about filing briefs and taking legal positions are up to the Justice Department.&nbsp; Those are, you know &#8212; these are enforcement-related issues, so we are not directing that from the White House.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I think you can see in the work that has happened to date that it&#8217;s a priority, and we’d certainly refer you to the Justice Department for any further questions about their engagement.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Thank you, [senior administration official].&nbsp; And thank you, everybody, for joining.&nbsp; As a reminder, this call is attributable to “senior administration officials,” and the call and the pre- &#8212; and the factsheet are embargoed until 12:00 p.m. &#8212; noon.<br><br>Any questions, let me know.&nbsp; Thank you, all.<br><br>9:56 A.M. EDT&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>This morning, I spoke with President Zelenskyy to discuss Russia’s brutal and ongoing war against Ukraine. I reaffirmed my commitment that the United States will stand by Ukraine as it defends its democracy and support its sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of unprovoked Russian aggression.</p>



<p>I informed President Zelenskyy that the United States is providing another $1 billion in security assistance for Ukraine, including additional artillery and coastal defense weapons, as well as ammunition for the artillery and advanced rocket systems that the Ukrainians need to support their defensive operations in the Donbas. We also discussed Secretary Austin’s efforts in Brussels today to coordinate additional international support for the Ukrainian armed forces.</p>



<p>We also remain committed to supporting the Ukrainian people whose lives have been ripped apart by this war. Today, I am also announcing an additional $225 million in humanitarian assistance to help people inside Ukraine, including by supplying safe drinking water, critical medical supplies and health care, food, shelter, and cash for families to purchase essential items.</p>



<p>The bravery, resilience, and determination of the Ukrainian people continues to inspire the world. And the United States, together with our allies and partners, will not waver in our commitment to the Ukrainian people as they fight for their freedom.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em><em>Biden Administration will facilitate air shipment of approximately 548,000 8-ounce bottle equivalents of&nbsp;Nestlé&nbsp;Alfamino</em>®<em> and Alfamino</em>®<em>Junior specialty infant formula this week</em></em></p>



<p>Today, President Biden is announcing that his Administration has arranged the sixth Operation Fly Formula flight. Delta Air Lines will transport Kendamil formula free of charge from Heathrow Airport in London to Logan Airport in Boston and Detroit Metro Airport between June 20 and June 24.</p>



<p>These Operation Fly Formula flights donated by Delta will contain more than 212,000 pounds or approximately 3.2 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Kendamil infant formula and will begin shipping on June 20.</p>



<p>The Kendamil Organic and Classic formula, made available through Operation Fly Formula, will be distributed and available for purchase at select U.S. retailers nationwide, as well as online. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is exercising enforcement discretion so that Kendamil can import infant formula under the Kendamil brand. Kendamil will export up to at least 2 million cans of Kendamil infant formula – the equivalent of at least 54 million 8-ounce bottles to the United States. Parents can learn more about Kendamil infant formula at&nbsp;<a href="https://kendamil.com/">https://kendamil.com/</a>&nbsp;and visit the United States website at&nbsp;<a href="https://us.kendamil.com/">https://us.kendamil.com/</a>&nbsp;for updates and information on retail locations.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the importation of safe infant formula and start getting more formula to stores as soon as possible. Under Operation Fly Formula, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense (DOD) are partnering to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S. health and safety standards so it can get to store shelves faster. Yesterday, Operation Fly Formula flights landed in Texas with 1.6 million bottle equivalents of Nestlé NAN SupremePro Stage 1 infant formula, and the first shipment of 3.7 million bottle equivalents of Kendamil infant formula landed in Virginia aboard a donated United Airlines flight.</p>



<p>In addition, the Biden Administration has taken a number of other important actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula for families, including invoking the Defense Production Act, entering into a consent agreement between the FDA to reopen Abbott Nutrition’s Sturgis facility, and issuing FDA guidance so that major formula manufacturers can safely import formula that is not currently being produced for the U.S. market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>President Biden believes that no one should face discrimination because of who they are or whom they love. Since President Biden took office, he has championed the rights of LGBTQI+ Americans and people around the world, accelerating the march towards full equality.<br><br>As President Biden said during his first joint address to Congress, the President has the back of LGBTQI+ people across the country. That is why he taking these bold actions and continuing to fight for full equality for every American – including urging Congress pass the Equality Act and provide overdue civil rights protections for LGBTQI+ people. <br><br>Today, to mark Pride Month, President Biden will sign an Executive Order Advancing Equality for LGBTQI+ Individuals, and he will welcome LGBTQI+ families, advocates, elected officials, and leaders to the White House for a reception. <br><br>President Biden’s Executive Order builds on the historic progress he has made for LGBTQI+ people by:<br></p>



<ul><li>Addressing discriminatory legislative attacks against LGBTQI+ children and families, directing key agencies to protect families and children;&nbsp;</li><li>Preventing so-called “conversion therapy” with a historic initiative to protect children from the harmful practice;</li><li>Safeguarding health care, and programs designed to prevent youth suicide;</li><li>Supporting LGBTQI+ children and families by launching a new initiative to protect foster youth, prevent homelessness, and improve access to federal programs; and</li><li>Taking new, additional steps to advance LGBTQI+ equality.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>ADDRESSING DISCRIMINATORY LEGISLATIVE ATTACKS<br></strong><br>Over 300 anti-LGBTQI+ laws have been introduced in state legislatures over the past year, and many of them specifically target transgender children and their parents by banning access to medical care and support at school.&nbsp;President Biden is addressing these harmful, hateful, and discriminatory attacks head-on – not only by speaking up for America’s families, but taking action to stand up to the bullies targeting LGBTQI+ people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help support impacted families, President Biden is charging the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) with protecting LGBTQI+ children and families from attacks on their access to health care, and has instructed HHS to release new sample policies for states on how to expand access to comprehensive health care for LGBTQI+ patients. The President is also directing the Department of Education with addressing the impacts of state laws that target LGBTQI+ students, and has charged the department with releasing a sample school policy for achieving full inclusion for LGBTQI+ students.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ADDRESSING “CONVERSION THERAPY”<br></strong><br>As a candidate, President Biden pledged to help end so-called “conversion therapy” – a discredited and dangerous practice that seeks to suppress or change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQI+ people. Today, President Biden is using his executive authority to launch an initiative to protect children across America and crack down on this harmful practice, which every major medical association in the United States has condemned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Children who are exposed to so-called “conversion therapy” face higher rates of attempted suicide and trauma. Numerous states across the country have already passed bipartisan laws to prevent exposure to so-called “conversion therapy,” with Republican and Democratic governors signing state bans on conversion therapy into law. Yet despite these efforts, many people in the United States and around the world are still subjected to this practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>President Biden is charging HHS with leading an initiative to reduce the risk of youth exposure to this dangerous practice. HHS will explore guidance to clarify that federally-funded programs cannot offer so-called “conversion therapy.” HHS will also increase public awareness about its harms, provide training and technical assistance to health care providers, and expand support for services to help survivors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>President Biden is also encouraging the Federal Trade Commission to consider whether the practice constitutes an unfair or deceptive act or practice, and whether to issue consumer warnings or notices. And, he is directing the Secretaries of State, Treasury, and HHS to develop an action plan to promote an end to so-called “conversion therapy” around the world and ensure that U.S. foreign assistance dollars do not fund the practice.<br><br><strong>SAFEGUARDING HEALTH CARE AND PREVENTING LGBTQI+ YOUTH SUICIDE<br></strong><br>Because of discrimination and bullying,&nbsp;nearly half of LGBTQI+ youth seriously considered suicide last year. LGBTQI+ people of all ages also face significant barriers to accessing health care, and LGBTQI+ patients face significant health disparities. To safeguard access to health care for LGBTQI+ patients and address the LGBTQI+ youth mental health crisis, President Biden is&nbsp;charging HHS with taking steps to address the barriers and exclusionary policies that LGBTQI+ individuals and families face in accessing quality, affordable, comprehensive health care, including mental health care, reproductive health care, and HIV prevention and treatment. The President’s Order charges HHS to work with states to promote expanded access to gender-affirming care. It also charges HHS to help prevent LGBTQI+ suicide by expanding youth access to suicide prevention resources, and to issue new guidance through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration on providing evidence-informed mental health care for LGBTQI+ youth.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>SUPPORTING LGBTQI+ CHILDREN AND FAMILIES&nbsp;<br></strong><br>LGBTQI+ children and families deserve the same dignity and respect as all American families. But LGBTQI+ children and families continue to face significant barriers and discrimination. For LGBTQI+ young people, family rejection can lead to disproportionately high rates of homelessness and over-representation in foster care. And for LGBTQI+ parents and households, significant barriers remain in accessing vital government benefits and services, and achieving housing security.&nbsp;Providing these young Americans and families with the resources and support they need will help ensure more children and families have access to loving homes that decrease the risk of abuse and suicide.&nbsp;<br>President Biden’s Executive Order will:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Address discrimination and barriers faced by LGBTQI+ youth, parents, caretakers, and families in foster care.&nbsp;</strong>Although LGBTQI+ parents play a vital role in ensuring that every child in America has a loving home, and are seven times more likely to adopt a child from foster care, these parents continue to face barriers and biases in the child welfare system. To address these disparities, President Biden is charging HHS with strengthening LGBTQI+ non-discrimination protections in the foster care system. His Executive Order also charges HHS with launching a new initiative to partner with state child welfare agencies to improve outcomes for LGBTQI+ youth in care; increase training for child welfare personnel on best practices for supporting LGBTQI+ youth; promote placements of children into environments that will support their sexual orientation and gender identity; and study and address the disproportionate rates of child removals that LGBTQI+ parents face, especially women of color.<br></li><li><strong>Support families with LGBTQI+ youth.&nbsp;</strong>When youth come out as LGBTQI+, parents and family members often seek help to learn how to best support their child. When children face rejection by their families, they risk higher rates of homelessness and attempted suicide. To support families with LGBTQI+ youth, President Biden is directing HHS to expand access to voluntary family counseling and support programs to help support youth and families. The President’s Executive Order also charges the Center for Disease Control and Prevention with researching the impacts of family rejection on the mental health and long-term wellbeing of LGBTQI+ individuals.<br></li><li><strong>Review access, and barriers, for families to federal programs and benefits.&nbsp;</strong>In spite of important progress in ensuring that same-sex married couples can access federal programs, many LGBTQI+ families continue to face barriers in accessing vital benefits and services. For LGBTQI+ people who have faced family rejection and rely on family structures without legal or blood ties, these barriers can be particularly pronounced. To strengthen supports for all families, the President’s Executive Order directs HHS to conduct a study of how current eligibility standards for federal programs impact LGBTQI+ and other households, and issue recommendations for more inclusive standards. The Executive Order also directs the Office of Management and Budget to coordinate with agencies as they seek opportunities to implement those recommendations in their programs and services.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Address LGBTQI+ homelessness and housing instability.&nbsp;</strong>President Biden is directing the Department of Housing and Urban Development with launching a new Working Group on LGBTQI+ Homelessness and Housing Equity. That Working Group will lead new efforts to identity and address the barriers to housing faced by LGBTQI+ people, provide guidance and technical assistance to housing providers on serving LGBTQI+ individuals, and seek new funding opportunities for culturally appropriate services that address barriers to housing for LGBTQI+ individuals.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Support LGBTQI+ students in our Nation&#8217;s schools and educational institutions.&nbsp;</strong>The President’s Executive Order directs the Department of Education to establish a new Working Group on LGBTQI+ Students and Families, which will advance policies for states, school districts, and other educational institutions to promote safe and inclusive learning environments in which all students thrive.<br></li><li><strong>Support LGBTQI+ youth in juvenile justice systems.&nbsp;</strong>The Executive Order charges the Attorney General with establishing a new clearinghouse within the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to provide effective training, technical assistance, and other resources for jurisdictions to better serve LGBTQI+ youth involved in the juvenile justice system.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>ADDITIONAL STEPS TO ADVANCE LGBTQI+ EQUALITY</strong><br>President Biden’s Executive Order also includes additional new steps to advance LGBTQI+ equality, including:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Strengthen supports for LGBTQI+ older adults.&nbsp;</strong>Older&nbsp;LGBTQI+ people face significant rates of discrimination, isolation, and poverty. The President’s Executive Order directs HHS to publish a “Bill of Rights for LGBTQI+ Older Adults” and new guidance on the non-discrimination protections for older adults in long-term care settings. It also charges HHS with exploring new rulemaking to establish that LGBTQI+ individuals are included in the definition of populations of “greatest social need” under the Older Americans Act.<br></li><li><strong>Promote expanded federal data collection on sexual orientation and gender identity.&nbsp;</strong>To strengthen the federal collection of sexual orientation and gender identity (“SOGI”) data, the President’s Executive Order establishes a new federal coordinating committee on SOGI data, which will lead efforts across agencies to identify opportunities to strengthen SOGI data collection, while safeguarding privacy protections and civil rights for LGBTQI+ individuals.</li></ul>



<p><strong>BUILDING ON HISTORIC PROGRESS</strong><br><br>Today’s announcements build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic progress to advance LGBTQI+ equality since taking office, including:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Strengthening civil rights protections.&nbsp;</strong>On his first day in office, President Biden signed an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-preventing-and-combating-discrimination-on-basis-of-gender-identity-or-sexual-orientation/">Executive Order</a>&nbsp;on preventing and combatting discrimination against LGBTQI+ Americans.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Ending the ban on transgender servicemembers, and supporting LGBTQI+ service members and veterans.&nbsp;</strong>President Biden rescinded the discriminatory ban on transgender servicemembers, and the Department of Defense announced that HIV-positive service members with an undetectable viral load will no longer be categorically barred from deploying worldwide or commissioning, nor will they be discharged or separated, solely on the basis of their HIV-positive status. The Department of Veterans Affairs also strengthened services and supports for LGBTQI+ veterans, including by removing the outdated ban on comprehensive gender-affirming care for transgender veterans.<br></li><li><strong>Fighting back against state-level attacks on LGBTQI+ children.&nbsp;</strong>The Department of Justice has intervened and filed statements of interest in lawsuits across the country challenging state laws that seek to ban transgender children from accessing gender-affirming health care and participating in school activities as unconstitutional.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Advancing human rights for LGBTQI+ people in America’s foreign policy.&nbsp;</strong>President Biden signed a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/04/memorandum-advancing-the-human-rights-of-lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender-queer-and-intersex-persons-around-the-world/">Presidential Memorandum</a>&nbsp;on Advancing the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons Around the World, and&nbsp;&nbsp;appointed the first Special Envoy to Advance the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons at the State Department.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Strengthening supports and protections for transgender Americans.&nbsp;</strong>The State Department now offers an “X” gender marker option to ensure nonbinary Americans can access an accurate federal ID. The Department of Homeland Security announced reforms to address barriers and heightened screening that transgender travelers often face in U.S. airports. The Department of Housing and Urban Development also restored key protections to ensure that transgender people experiencing homelessness can access emergency shelters consistent with their gender identity.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Fighting for passage of the Equality Act.&nbsp;</strong>President Biden&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/25/fact-sheet-the-equality-act-will-provide-long-overdue-civil-rights-protections-for-millions-of-americans/">continues to call</a>&nbsp;on the Senate to swiftly pass the Equality Act, legislation, which will provide long overdue federal civil rights protections to LGBTQI+ Americans and their families.<br></li><li><strong>Renewing the U.S. government’s commitment to ending the HIV epidemic at home and around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>President Biden released a new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/National-HIV-AIDS-Strategy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National HIV/AIDS Strategy</a>&nbsp; to lead us toward ending the HIV epidemic in the United States by 2030.&nbsp;The President reestablished the White House Office of National AIDS Policy, and has made historic investments in ending the HIV epidemic globally.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Appointing LGBTQI+ leaders to the highest levels of our government.&nbsp;</strong>President Biden has appointed a historically diverse Administration, including Secretary Pete Buttigieg, the first openly gay Cabinet Secretary; Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Rachel Levine, the first openly transgender person ever confirmed by the U.S. Senate; Ambassador Chantale Wong, the first open lesbian to achieve the rank of Ambassador; and the first openly gay White House Counsel, Stuart Delery. Fourteen percent of the President’s appointees identify as LGBTQI+.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Ensuring the federal government is a model employer for LGBTQI+ public servants.</strong>President Biden signed an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/25/executive-order-on-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce/">Executive Order</a>&nbsp;on Advancing Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce, with key provisions for LGBTQI+ public servants.<br></li><li><strong>Celebrating Pride at home and around the world.</strong>&nbsp;Pride is back at the White House&nbsp;and federal buildings throughout the country are proudly flying Pride flags this month. The State Department announced it will allow U.S. embassies and diplomatic outposts to fly the Pride flag on the same flagpole as the U.S. flag at their embassy or consulate.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p><strong>By Betsy Lawrence</strong></p>



<p>On June 15, 2012, the Department of Homeland Security announced the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-individuals-who-came-to-us-as-children.pdf">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy</a>, which has allowed hundreds of thousands of noncitizens who were brought to the United States as children to live, study, and work in our communities—contributing to our economy and the future of our country—without fear of removal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, on the 10<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Anniversary of DACA, the Biden-Harris Administration celebrates the remarkable contributions of Dreamers and DACA recipients, reaffirms its commitment to preserving this landmark policy, and calls on Congress to pass legislation to provide lasting protections to Dreamers.</p>



<p><strong>Economic Contributions and Educational Achievements of DACA Recipients</strong></p>



<p>DACA has profoundly improved the lives and economic circumstances of individual recipients and their families—and by extension, the communities in which they live, and our country as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 2012, approximately 825,000 individuals have been granted DACA.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>DACA recipients have increased earning potential</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.utsa.edu/today/2021/10/story/study-daca-protection.html">2021 study by the University of Texas at San Antonio</a>, DACA beneficiaries experienced increases in college enrollment and degree completions, as well as more professional job opportunities, as compared to their non-DACA-eligible counterparts.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period of 2012 to 2016—</p>



<ul><li>the number of DACA recipients with a Bachelor’s degree tripled;</li></ul>



<ul><li>professional job attainment for DACA recipients grew by 34%; and</li><li>the incomes of DACA recipients more than doubled.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The benefits of this increase in prosperity extend well beyond DACA recipients and their families.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-demographic-and-economic-impacts-of-daca-recipients-fall-2021-edition/#:~:text=DACA%20has%20enabled%20recipients%20to,in%20their%20communities%20and%20nationwide.">DACA households have significant spending power</a>—they own more than 68,000 homes across the country, contribute $760 million in mortgage payments and $2.5 billion in rental payments annually, and pay $6.2 billion in federal taxes and $3.3 billion in state and local taxes each year.</p>



<p><em>DACA recipients enrich our lives and make us safer</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 343,000 DACA recipients are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-demographic-and-economic-impacts-of-daca-recipients-fall-2021-edition/">employed in industries deemed essential</a>&nbsp;by the&nbsp;Department of Homeland Security. This includes an estimated 20,000 educators in our nation’s schools and classrooms, 34,000 healthcare workers, and 100,000 food supply chain workers who have worked tirelessly to support and sustain us during the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>DACA strengthens American families</em>. With the peace of mind that comes with protection from removal, DACA keeps families together.&nbsp;&nbsp;An estimated 300,000 U.S. citizen children have at least one parent with DACA, and&nbsp;<a href="https://americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DACA-Survey-20201.pdf?_ga=2.16623926.1462940483.1654022316-1443532221.1653581699">roughly three-fourths of DACA recipients have a U.S. citizen child, sibling, spouse, or parent</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Economic Benefits of Permanent Protections for Dreamers</strong></p>



<p>Of the 825,000 noncitizens who have been granted DACA since 2012,&nbsp;<a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/homesec/R46764.pdf">76,000 have since become lawful permanent residents (green card holders)</a>&nbsp;and approximately&nbsp;<a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/homesec/R46764.pdf">4,000 have gone on to become naturalized U.S. citizens</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;While strengthening and fortifying DACA is essential, providing permanent protections to Dreamers and others will generate even more economic value for the country.</p>



<p>At a time when American employers are struggling to find workers in critical industries, providing an opportunity for DACA recipients and Dreamers to obtain lawful status will increase the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2021/09/17/the-economic-benefits-of-extending-permanent-legal-status-to-unauthorized-immigrants/">effective labor supply and boost economic growth</a>. Permanent protections would allow this population to contribute indefinitely to the economy in sectors that are heavily reliant on immigrant workers, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2021/09/17/the-economic-benefits-of-extending-permanent-legal-status-to-unauthorized-immigrants/">agriculture, construction, and leisure and hospitality</a>, while also providing increased job mobility and better employment options with long term trajectories for growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies show that new permanent residents have greater productivity than their undocumented counterparts and generate increased&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2021/09/17/the-economic-benefits-of-extending-permanent-legal-status-to-unauthorized-immigrants/">tax revenues</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>DACA recipients enrich our nation with their deep community ties, exceptional talents, and work ethic.&nbsp;&nbsp;On&nbsp;Day Oneof this&nbsp;Administration, President Biden directed the Department&nbsp;of&nbsp;Homeland Security&nbsp;and&nbsp;the Department of Justice to take&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/preserving-and-fortifying-deferred-action-for-childhood-arrivals-daca/">all appropriate actions to “preserve and fortify” DACA</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Biden Administration has worked vigorously to defend DACA in court and is working expeditiously on a rule to codify and preserve the policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, however, only Congress can&nbsp;provide&nbsp;the permanent relief that&nbsp;Dreamers&nbsp;need and that our country deserves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, for more than two decades, efforts to pass legislation providing a durable solution for Dreamers have failed.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was 2001 when Senators Durbin and Hatch introduced the first bipartisan Dream Act, offering conditional residency and a path to permanent residence to undocumented immigrants who entered the United States as children. In March 2021, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 6, the American Dream and Promise Act, introduced by Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, with bipartisan support.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ten-year anniversary of DACA, the Biden-Harris Administration celebrates DACA recipients and again calls on Congress to pass legislation to protect and&nbsp;honor Dreamers who make our country stronger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>$1 Billion from Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Made Available to Communities, First Tranche of $5 Billion to Help Communities Tackle Water Contaminants</em></p>



<p>President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that every American deserves to drink clean water. But for too many communities across this country, children and families are drinking water that is contaminated with lead and dangerous chemicals. That is why the President and Vice President unveiled a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/18/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-launches-plan-to-combat-pfas-pollution/">plan to combat water pollution</a>&nbsp;and, six months ago, launched the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/16/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-lead-pipe-and-paint-action-plan/">Biden-Harris Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan</a>&nbsp;outlining how the Administration is leveraging $55 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to replace all of America’s lead pipes. Together, these plans represent how the President and Vice President have activated an unprecedented effort to deliver clean water across America and mobilized federal, state, and local investments to confront contamination, protect public health, and advance environmental justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new findings and actions that will help to protect Americans’ drinking water from contamination, including from “forever chemicals” like per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). PFAS are&nbsp;a set of human-made chemicals that&nbsp;can cause cancer and other severe health problems, pose a serious threat across rural, suburban, and urban areas, and that disproportionately affect disadvantaged communities. PFAS are considered “forever chemicals” because they are environmentally persistent, bioaccumulative, and remain in human bodies for a long time.<br><br><strong>NEW PUBLIC HEALTH INFORMATION<br></strong><br>First,&nbsp;EPA is publishing four new drinking water lifetime health advisories for certain PFAS&nbsp;as part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/18/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-launches-plan-to-combat-pfas-pollution/#:~:text=Consistent%20with%20President%20Biden's%20commitment,from%20discharging%20PFAS%20into%20America's">President’s plan to combat PFAS pollution</a>&nbsp;and the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epa.gov/pfas/pfas-strategic-roadmap-epas-commitments-action-2021-2024">PFAS Roadmap</a>.&nbsp;These health advisories reflect the&nbsp;Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to follow the science and up-to-date public health information.&nbsp;Specifically:</p>



<ul><li>EPA is releasing&nbsp;<em><u>interim</u></em>&nbsp;updated drinking water lifetime health advisories for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) that replace those issued by EPA in 2016. The updated advisory levels are based on new science that indicates that some negative health effects may occur with concentrations of PFOA or PFOS in water that are near zero&nbsp;<br></li><li>EPA is also releasing&nbsp;<em><u>final</u></em>&nbsp;health advisories for perfluorobutane sulfonic acid and its potassium salt (PFBS), and hexafluoropropylene oxide (HFPO) dimer acid and its ammonium salt (“GenX” chemicals). In chemical and product manufacturing, GenX chemicals are considered a replacement for PFOA, and PFBS is considered a replacement for PFOS.<br></li></ul>



<p><strong>INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS TO ADDRESS WATER POLLUTION</strong><br><br>Second, EPA is making available $1 billion in grant funding through President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to help communities that are on the frontlines of PFAS contamination, the first of $5 billion through the Law that can be used to reduce PFAS in drinking water in communities facing disproportionate impacts. These funds can be used in small or disadvantaged communities to address emerging contaminants like PFAS in drinking water through actions such as technical assistance, water quality testing, contractor training, and installation of centralized treatment technologies and systems.<br><br>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides a historic $5 billion in a new Emerging Contaminants in Small or Disadvantaged Communities Grant Program for states to reduce PFAS and other contaminants in drinking water in underserved communities. In total, the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides $10 billion in funding to specifically address PFAS and other emerging contaminants in water.<br><br>EPA will be reaching out to states and territories with information on how to submit their letter of intent to participate in this new grant program. EPA will also consult with Tribes and Alaskan Native Villages regarding the Tribal set-aside for this grant program. This funding complements $3.4 billion in funding that is going through the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRFs) and $3.2 billion through the Clean Water SRFs that can also be used to address PFAS in water this year.<br><br><strong><br>TOOLS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERMMENTS</strong><br><br>Third, in addition to these resources outlined above, the Administration is outlining additional tools state and local governments can use to address PFAS pollution and protect drinking water:</p>



<ul><li>Implementing a recently-launched new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-nationwide-monitoring-effort-better-understand-extent-pfas-drinking">nationwide monitoring program</a>&nbsp;for PFAS in water systems to detect more types of PFAS, at lower levels, in more drinking water systems;</li><li>Proactively using the EPA’s Clean Water Act federal permitting authorities to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-04/npdes_pfas-memo.pdf">restrict&nbsp;discharges of PFAS</a>&nbsp;at the source and to obtain more comprehensive monitoring information on potential sources of PFAS;&nbsp;</li><li>Developing a national drinking water standard for certain PFAS that will be proposed this fall; and</li><li>Publishing the results of water quality tests in non-DOD drinking water systems that are located near and downstream of military installations.</li></ul>



<p><strong>ADDITIONAL COORDINATED STEPS TO TACKLE PFAS</strong><br><br>The White House is coordinating a government-wide approach to emerging science and policy in real-time. The Council on Environmental Quality leads the Interagency Policy Committee on PFAS and the Office of Science and Technology Policy continues to coordinate accelerated PFAS research within the National Science and Technology Council’s Joint Subcommittee on Environment, Innovation, and Public Health. Both groups continue to assess the need for new policies and scientific research that result from emerging information about PFAS. There will also be enhanced coordination by senior leadership and staff from the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Defense, and Council on Environmental Quality under the Interagency Policy Committee on PFAS concerning issues around military installations and their communities to accelerate solutions and increase transparency.<br><br>Additionally, the Biden-Harris Administration will continue to work with Congress to secure the President’s Fiscal Year 2023 Budget Request, which includes $126 million for EPA to assess the impacts of PFAS on human health and advance technologies needed to detect PFAS in water. The Administration is also prioritizing prevention of contaminated water supplies as part of the re-ignited Cancer Moonshot to end cancer as we know it which is a pillar of the President’s Unity Agenda for the country. <br><br>Outlined below is how the Biden-Harris Administration is leveraging tools from across the government to <strong>restrict</strong>PFAS from entering the nation’s water, air, land, and food; <strong>clean up</strong> PFAS pollution and holding polluters accountable; and accelerate<strong> research and development </strong>on PFAS science and solutions. <br><br><strong><em>Restricting PFAS from entering Americans’ water, air, land, and food:</em></strong><br></p>



<ul><li><strong>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>is continuing to expand its testing of the food supply,</strong>including expanding its PFAS analysis method development and announcing additional testing results from the general food supply and targeted testing of seafood as those results become available.<br></li><li><strong>The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Farm Service Agency (FSA) has amended the&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fsa.usda.gov%2Fnews-room%2Fnews-releases%2F2021%2Fusda-opens-2022-signup-for-dairy-margin-coverage-expands-program-for-supplemental-production&amp;data=04%7C01%7C%7C3f988a7f1f5a407fccf508d9fd5dd53e%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C0%7C0%7C637819401718059648%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=%2BDVK%2BWMv8Mp5%2Fu2WMOQE7YubxyG2%2BGS7bSKM68w52RM%3D&amp;reserved=0"><strong>Dairy Indemnity Payment Program</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;regulations to compensate dairy farmers&nbsp;</strong>whose&nbsp;cows cannot be put on the market due to PFAS contamination.<br></li><li><strong>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is leading a set of initiatives to investigate and remediate PFAS and protect emergency responders, including the first-ever inventory of PFAS use and prior releases from its facilities, like fire-fighting foam and possible water source contamination.<br></strong></li><li><strong>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has implemented a policy to eliminate the discharge of firefighting foam containing PFAS for testing purposes,</strong>&nbsp;and has also provided funding for airports to use systems that do not require the discharge of foam.&nbsp;FAA is partnering with DOD on research on PFAS-free firefighting foam.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Cleaning up PFAS pollution and to hold polluters accountable:</em></strong><br></p>



<ul><li><strong>In the coming weeks, EPA will issue a proposed rule to designate PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances&nbsp;</strong>under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), which will enable EPA to leverage the full range of Superfund authorities, including requiring reporting of PFOA and PFOS releases and to hold polluters accountable by recovering cleanup costs.</li><li><strong>EPA has developed a&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.epa.gov/assessing-and-managing-chemicals-under-tsca/national-pfas-testing-strategy"><strong>National PFAS Testing Strategy</strong></a>&nbsp;and has issued the first in a&nbsp;series of Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) test orders to require companies to conduct and submit testing PFAS.</li><li><a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-adds-five-pfas-chemicals-list-regional-screening-and-removal-management-levels"><strong>EPA recently added</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;five PFAS to the list of Regional Screening Levels (RSLs) and Regional Removal Management Levels (RMLs),</strong>&nbsp;which help EPA determine if further investigation or actions are needed to protect public health in locations where PFAS is detected.</li><li><strong>DOD will issue guidance in early summer to implement EPA’s recently updated Regional Screening Levels (RSLs) for PFAS across DOD’s PFAS sites nationwide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>These lower values will incorporate the latest peer-reviewed science and will result in more sites moving forward in the cleanup process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>DOD continues to address its PFAS releases and has completed initial assessments at over 300 of 700 installations and started 168 remedial investigations</strong>, the next step in the cleanup process. DOD is also continuing research and demonstration on over 100 projects related to PFAS treatment technologies, sampling, analysis, and monitoring.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)&nbsp;have, since October of 2021,&nbsp;released&nbsp;six&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/activities/assessments.html"><strong>PFAS exposure assessment</strong></a><strong>reports&nbsp;</strong>for communities located in&nbsp;Westfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/activities/assessments/sites/berkeley-county-wv.html">Berkeley County, West Virginia</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/activities/assessments/sites/new-castle-county-de.html">New Castle County, Delaware</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/activities/assessments/sites/spokane-county-wa.html">Spokane County, Washington</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/activities/assessments/sites/lubbock-county-tx.html">Lubbock County, Texas</a>; and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/activities/assessments/sites/fairbanks-north-star-borough-ak.html">Moose Creek, Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Accelerating the research and development of PFAS science and solutions include:</em></strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>ATSDR is partnering with EPA to expand on the environmental measurements gathered as part of ongoing PFAS exposure assessments.</strong>&nbsp;The investigation will collect environmental samples to evaluate levels of PFAS in the indoor and outdoor environment that may contribute to elevated levels of PFAS in blood in study participants.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM)&nbsp;</strong>has been funded by CDC/ATSDR and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)<strong>&nbsp;to review the current evidence regarding human health effects of PFAS</strong>&nbsp;that will help inform clinician guidance regarding PFAS exposure.<br></li><li><strong>The National Institute of Standards and Technology is developing a new reference material, expected to be available by the end of the year, for PFAS in aqueous firefighting foams, a fire suppressant used in firefighting.</strong>&nbsp;NIST is working with organizations including the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the US Fire Administration on research to understand how much PFAS from the foams gets on fire-fighting gear and how PFAS is released, including exposure from use of Personal Protective Equipment, to help reduce a firefighter’s risk of being exposed to PFAS.&nbsp;</li></ul>
