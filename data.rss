										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>12:56 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, what was your message to the families?&nbsp; What was your message to the families?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; What was the question?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What was your message to the families, Mr. President?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; My message was: They’re going to be in pain for a long while.&nbsp; But they will get to the point where something &#8212; they’ll open a closet door or they’ll ride by a park or they’ll eat their favorite ice cream, and they’ll think of the person they lost and they’ll smile before they cry.&nbsp; And that’s when they know you’re going to make it.&nbsp; Until then, you’re not sure.&nbsp; But it will happen.&nbsp; It’ll come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, do you believe that certain members of Congress, the Republican Party, as well as Tucker Carlson, who have echoed the replacement theory, deserve some blame for violent acts like this?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I don’t think anybody who echoes a replacement is to blame &#8212; not for this particular crime.&nbsp; But it’s for no purpose &#8212; no purpose except for profit and/or political benefit.&nbsp; And it’s wrong.&nbsp; It’s just simply wrong.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What more can you do on guns via executive action?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Not much on executive action.&nbsp; I’ve got to convince the Congress that we should go back to what I passed years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I mean &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How are you doing that?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, I’m going to try.&nbsp; I’m going to try.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What’s your &#8212; what is your thoughts about next steps in Congress?&nbsp; Do you think there’s an opportunity or a prospect for more movement there?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; The answer is going to be very difficult.&nbsp; It’s going to be very difficult.&nbsp; But I’m not going to give up trying.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, is it time for a domestic terrorism statute?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, we have enough laws on the books to deal with what’s going on now.&nbsp; We just have to &#8212; we have to deal with it.</p>



<p>Look, part of what the country has to do is look in the mirror and face the reality.&nbsp; We have a problem with domestic terror.&nbsp; It’s real.</p>



<p>I know you don’t want to hear me &#8212; not you.&nbsp; People don’t want to hear me saying it.&nbsp; They say, “Well, he’s the President.&nbsp; He’s a Democrat.&nbsp; He’s…”&nbsp; But that’s what the intelligence community has been saying; that’s what the military has been saying for a long time.&nbsp; There’s nothing we can do about this.&nbsp; Nothing to do about this.</p>



<p>And, look, there is a lot of people, like this murderer who committed this act, who are just deranged, who are susceptible, who are &#8212; who are just lost and don’t know what to do, and they’re easily taken &#8212; they’re easily sucked in.&nbsp; And it’s got to stop.&nbsp; We have to admit it.&nbsp; I don’t know why we don’t admit what the hell is going on.</p>



<p>Anyway, thank you very much.&nbsp; We’ll get on the plane.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Aboard Air Force One<br>En Route Buffalo, New York</p>



<p>9:07 A.M. EDT</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Hello, hello, hello.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I’ll try and speak loudly.</p>



<p>Good morning.&nbsp; As you all know, we are headed to Buffalo, where the President and the First Lady will mourn with a grieving city. &nbsp;During the trip, the President and the First Lady will visit Tops Market memorial where they&#8217;ll pa- &#8212; where they’ll pay their respects to the lives of lost &#8212; to the lives lost in Saturday&#8217;s tragic shooting.</p>



<p>Afterward, the President and First Lady will meet with family members of the victims, law enforcement and first responders, and local leaders at a community center to offer their condolences and comfort to those affected by this tragedy.</p>



<p>After, the President will deliver remarks at the community center.&nbsp; The President will call this despicable act for what it is: terrorism motivated by a hateful and perverse ideology that tears at the sco- &#8212; the soul of our nation.&nbsp; He&#8217;ll call on all Americans to give hate no safe harbor and to reject the lies of racial animus that radicalize and divide us and lead to the act of racist violence we saw on Saturday that took the lives of 10 Americans.</p>



<p>President Biden will call on Congress to take action to keep weapons off war &#8212; weapons of war off our streets and keep guns out of the hands of criminals and people who have a serious mental illness that makes them a danger to themselves or others.</p>



<p>And the President will call on Americans to seek a more perfect union and embraces the diversity that has made us the world&#8217;s strongest and most dynamic nation in history of the world.</p>



<p>We &#8212; we&#8217;re joined on Air Force One by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and Congressman Brian Higgins who represents Buffalo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the ground in Buffalo, President Biden will be joined by Governor Kathy Hochul, Buffler [sic] &#8212; Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown, Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz, and Buffalo City Council President Reverend Darius Pridgen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the &#8212; in his meeting with first responders and local officials, the President will meet with the Buffalo Police Commissioner and De- &#8212; and Buffalo Deputy Fire Commissioner among many other state and local leaders.</p>



<p>We will, of course, share all of the &#8212; all of that in pool notes as we normally do.</p>



<p>Finally, I want to make sure you all saw that, on Thursday, President Biden will welcome the Prime Minister of Sweden and the President of Finland to the White House.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve got a short flight, so I&#8217;m going to just get to it. And, Chris, do you want to kick us off?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; So, the President said earlier when he took office that he wanted to boost efforts against domestic terrorism.&nbsp; Obviously, you know, this attack was carried out despite those efforts to refocus on white supremacy and domestic terrorism.&nbsp; Are there gaps in the administration&#8217;s efforts? &nbsp;And what is being done to boost those efforts now?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, I know that &#8212; that Congress, right now, is looking at the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been &#8212; we&#8217;ve been asked about that, so I just wanted to give an answer on that.&nbsp; You know, we&#8217;re still studying the details of the legislation, but the President has been clear in his commitment to countering domestic terrorism threats.</p>



<p>I talked a little bit about this yesterday, about what we have been doing in particular here in the administration.&nbsp; You know, we&#8217;ve been working to implement the government-wide National Strategy to Counter Domestic Terrorism President Biden directed his national security team to develop on his first full day in office.&nbsp; Recognize that that has evolved into the most urgent terrorism threat the United States faces today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, that works &#8212; that work includes &#8212; just very quickly &#8212; improving information sharing; adding resources to prevent domestic terrorism recruitment; increase our support for federal, state, and local law enforcement in addressing domestic terrorism nationwide; confronting long-term contributor &#8212; contributors to domestic terrorism; and rooting out hate and bigotry to fight gun crime.</p>



<p>As we have talked about, we are going to continue to call &#8212; I said that at the topper &#8212; on Congress to expand background checks, renew our ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and confirm Steve Dettelbach to head ATF.</p>



<p>I do want to go back to &#8212; a second &#8212; about law enforcement. &nbsp;And I also said this yesterday, but the way that the law enforcement &#8212; local law enforcement reacted and was on top of what happened in Buffalo and the other cities was &#8212; they should be commended.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so that&#8217;s what we want to continue to do: provide them the assistance that they need; when this sad events &#8212; these sad events happen, that they&#8217;re able to react in the way that’s saving lives and protecting lives the best that they can.</p>



<p><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, on NATO, Turkish President Erdoğan made some pretty strong comments yesterday suggesting that he would not want Finland and Sweden to join the Alliance.&nbsp; With those leaders coming to the White House tomorrow &#8212; or on Thursday, excuse me &#8212; what is the U.S. prepared to do to assuage Turkey’s concerns?&nbsp; Have the Turkish government communicated anything they want from the U.S. in terms of concessions?&nbsp; And what is the U.S. prepared to offer Turkey to reassure them about their &#8212; the Sweden and Finland NATO campaign?<br><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, Secretary Blinken spoke to this on Sunday.&nbsp; He held a press conference in Berlin &#8212; you know, meeting with his counterparts in NATO.<br><br>Look, we &#8212; we are confident that they will reach a consensus as an Alliance and &#8212; on an entry process should they decide to apply.&nbsp; So, that &#8212; we&#8217;re confident that, again &#8212; and Secretary Blinken &#8212; so I&#8217;m just really re-upping what he says: that there will be a consensus as it relates to Turkey and Sweden and Finland of applications.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What gives you confidence in that, given that &#8212; I mean, after Blinken’s comments, Erdoğan’s tone seemed to get even less optimistic or willing to allow them into the Alliance?</p>



<p><br>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I mean, look, as we know, there&#8217;s a lot of support for Sweden and Finland to &#8212; to join NATO.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen that in polling.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen that in voice support just across &#8212; across the NATO Alliances.&nbsp; And so, we have every confidence that there will be a consensus.<br><br>There &#8212; there&#8217;s conversations happening.&nbsp; I cannot speak for the Turkey government as what they need or what they&#8217;re looking for.&nbsp; But again, we feel very confident.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m &#8212; that is something that the &#8212; Secretary Blinken said himself after &#8212; when he was in Berlin recently.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, a question about guns.&nbsp; Can you give us a sense of what the administration&#8217;s intelligence is or view is right now of the potential for copycat attacks and what&#8217;s being done on that?&nbsp; And then I have a follow-up.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So I don&#8217;t have anything to share on any copycat attacks.&nbsp; I know I heard reporting that there was one in Buffalo, I think yesterday.&nbsp; That is something for, like, the local &#8212; clearly, the local &#8212; local enforcement to &#8212; you can go to them and ask them exactly what was happening there.<br><br>I don&#8217;t have anything to share on the federal government side.&nbsp; I laid out what we&#8217;re doing, what we have done in fighting domestic terrorism, but I don&#8217;t want &#8212; I don&#8217;t have more to share.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further on the issue of guns: Gun prevention groups or gun violence protection groups &#8212; prevention groups, rather &#8212; have been pressing the White House to start an office of gun violence protection.&nbsp; Is that something that President Biden is considering, particularly in light of this most recent attack?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So I would have to go back to the team and see if that is something that&#8217;s actually on the table.&nbsp; I have not heard of that.&nbsp; I could understand why that is being requested or asked, especially what we have been seeing these past &#8212; this past weekend.&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t have anything more to share or preview or anything to &#8212;</p>



<p><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Just one last follow-up on that, sorry.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just &#8212; what is next then for this administration in terms of next steps on gun violence and gun reform?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I mean, look, you know, we&#8217;ve said &#8212; you&#8217;ve heard us say this: Our country is facing an epidemic on gun violence that is costing lives every day, as we&#8217;ve seen most recently in Buffalo and other examples.&nbsp; The President is using every tool he can to fight gun violence.&nbsp; He&#8217;s done more through executive action than any President in their first history &#8212; in their first year in office.&nbsp;<br><br>And I &#8212; for example, we heard on Friday how over $10 billion from the Rescue Plan has been spent or committed on ways to fight gun crime.&nbsp; The President wants cities and states to use even more.&nbsp; The Justice Department issued a tough new rule to stem the flow of ghost guns, which are increasingly being found at crime scenes and which are the weapons of choice for terrorists and criminals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there&#8217;s so much more to do, and that&#8217;s why we are calling on Congress to act on what I was talking about: the expanded background checks, renew our ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazine, and confirm our ATF nominee as well.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine, you were talking about the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act.&nbsp; That &#8212; it’s somewhat broad in what it would do &#8212; increasing resources, what have you.&nbsp; Does the President think &#8212; does the President believe that there should be a domestic terrorism statute that allows prosecutors to charge suspects of mass shooting with domestic terrorism?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So in light of today&#8217;s evolving domestic terrorism threat, we have to consider whether legislation &#8212; legislative reforms could meaningfully and materially increase our ability to protect Americans from acts of domestic terrorism while simultaneously guarding against potential abuse and outreach.</p>



<p>You know, we have asked the Department of Justice as part of our strategy to counter domestic terrorism, as I just laid out, to closely examine whether new legislative authorities that balance safely &#8212; safety and the protection of civil liberties are necessary and appropriate.&nbsp; And this is something they have said they are carefully considering.&nbsp; So, this is still in progress as something that they&#8217;re looking at.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And also, yesterday, you were asked a couple of times about whether or not certain commentators and media, whether or not certain members of the Republican Party as well should share some blame in amplifying “replacement theory.”&nbsp; It seems like the administration at this point is not calling out by name some of those people that have, in fact, amplified that theory.</p>



<p>Can you walk through the thinking of the President and the White House of why this is not a time and why it&#8217;s not effective to call them out?&nbsp; Or do you feel that it&#8217;s not effective, and will you call them out by name?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So the people who spread this filth know who they are, and they should be ashamed of themselves.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m not going to give them or &#8212; give them or their obnoxious ideas they&#8217;re pushing the attention that they desperately want.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, the President has already called out this &#8212; this poisonous, false, hateful ideology, including on Saturday and Sunday, saying, “Any act of domestic terrorism, including an act perpetrated in the name of a repugnant white nationalist ideology, is antithetical to everything we stand for in America” and that “We must all work together to address the hate that remains a stain on the soul of America.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every leader should condemn that hate and certainly not echo it.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to focus on what unites us as Americans. That&#8217;s going to be what we&#8217;re focusing on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we should anticipate, in that case, as a follow to this, that we won&#8217;t hear that from the President today either?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I mean, just to reiterate, Jonathan, I&#8217;m not going to give them a platform.  So, I just want to make that very clear. </p>



<p>But we&#8217;re going to make our case directly to the people.&nbsp; We have a vision for this country &#8212; one where we combat hate, racism, and violence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We denounce white racism and domestic terror.&nbsp; We hope all will join us in denouncing hate and racism, as well as the conspiracy theories that run rampant online.</p>



<p>For today, as I stated earlier, is I &#8212; the President and the First Lady are going to comfort the grieving victims and the families who lost their loved ones.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s going to listen to them, he&#8217;s going to talk to them, and he&#8217;s going to be there for them as their President.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one more on a different topic.&nbsp; Over the weekend, there were a number of large demonstrations and rally in defense of abortion rights.&nbsp; The President, of course, has spoken that he supports that as well.&nbsp; Why did he not appear at any of these?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So the President and the Vice President were energized to see the many people peacefully gathering this past weekend.&nbsp; The administration continues to do everything possible to protect access to women&#8217;s reproductive rights, including working closely with abortion rights groups, providers, and elected officials, and more.&nbsp; But he was, indeed, gen- &#8212; energized to see what &#8212; folks coming out, peacefully protesting, and speaking out.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Go ahead, Sally.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, just on politics quickly.&nbsp; Does the President have any plans to watch the Pennsylvania returns tonight? &nbsp;Obviously, it&#8217;s his other home state.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a really important primary for both parties.&nbsp; And when can we expect to see more of him on the campaign trail heading into November?&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So I don&#8217;t have anything on his schedule on what that&#8217;s going to look like the next several months, going into November.&nbsp; So, as you know, I&#8217;m not going to go into politics from here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, obviously, Pennsylvania, as you were saying, Sally, is near and dear to the President &#8212; to President Biden.&nbsp; And he spent a lot of time on the ground there as President talking about his plan to lower costs for the American people there and the need to get something done in Congress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He&#8217;s going to continue to take his plan to the people of Pennsylvania and throughout the country.&nbsp; And as you’ve heard President Biden say over and over, “Don&#8217;t compare me to the Almighty.&nbsp; Compare me to the alternative.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right now, the ultra-MAGA congressional Republicans want to raise taxes on the middle class, take away a woman&#8217;s right to &#8212; to right &#8212; right to reproductive healthcare, and oppose the administration&#8217;s work to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and put more cops on the beat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The President isn&#8217;t going to shy away from underscoring the contrast between congressional Republicans and the work he and his administration are doing to lower prices and make our communities safe and stronger.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have anything for the &#8212; his future role as we go up into November.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just quickly on &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, Karine &#8212; and just &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, sorry &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last one, Karine &#8212;&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; (Inaudible) follow up.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, just on one other topic. &nbsp;Yesterday&#8217;s Cuba announcement from the administration &#8212; how closely is that related to the Summit of the Americas coming up?&nbsp; And when can we expect to see those formal invitations go out to the nations?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So, I don&#8217;t have anything new on the invites just quite yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But let me just give you a little bit of the announcement yesterday: The Cuban people are confronting an unprecedented humanitarian crisis, and our policy will continue to focus on empowering the Cuban people to help them create a future free from repression and economic suffering.</p>



<p>The President is fulfilling his commitment to the Cuban- American community and their family members in Cuba by facilitating family reunifications, strengthening fam- &#8212; family ties and facilitating educational connections, increasing support for independent Cuban entrepreneurs, ensuring that the remittances flow more freely to Cuban people while not enriching those who perpetrate human rights abuses.</p>



<p>These policy are designed to center on human rights and empowering the Cuban people to determine their own future.&nbsp; And so that is &#8212; that is our focus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know you asked me “Why now?”&nbsp; So the &#8212; following the large-scale protests in July 2021, President &#8212; President Biden directed his national security team to take action in two primary ways.&nbsp; And those are &#8212; those what &#8212; is what I just listed out.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s where it came from.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So one quick follow-up on Cuba.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does the Biden administration feel confident in the safety of the U.S. resources they&#8217;re sending to Cuba with these new steps when these anomalous health incidents haven&#8217;t been solved?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Well, you know, I get &#8212; I understand the question, but at the same time, we have to make sure that we&#8217;re helping the Cuban people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To your &#8212; to your question, that&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re monitoring, clearly, and just keeping a close eye on.&nbsp; But we also have to make sure that the Cuban people does &#8212; do not suffer.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And does the U.S. have a plan?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So that’s our focus there.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the U.S. have a plan if those attacks continue in Cuba?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything more to share beyond the announcement that we made yesterday.&nbsp; We are going to have our National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, with me at the podium tomorrow.&nbsp; So we can &#8212; that&#8217;s a question you can ask him.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I sneak in one more quick one?</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just &#8212; do you have an update on when the President will make a decision on student loan relief?&nbsp; And also, I&#8217;m wondering if the administration has assessed whether or not even relief for $10,000 &#8212; what kind of impact that could have on inflation.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; So let me start with your first question.&nbsp; We have no policy to announce yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as a reminder, no one has been required to pay a single dime of student loans since the President took office.&nbsp; You know, I will note that the administration’s actions have already provided more than $18.5 billion in targeted debt relief to more than 750,000 borrows [sic] &#8212; borrowers.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness &#8212; borrowers who have a total and permanent disability, borrowers who were misled by their college or university, and borrowers who attended ITT Technical Institutes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, the policy has not been &#8212; we haven&#8217;t announced it yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So this is your question about inflation:&nbsp; And &#8212; but I do want to state that Jared Bernstein has spoken to this before &#8212; your question, Zolan &#8212; and he&#8217;s mentioned that the impact on inflation by pausing federal loan repayments would be almost negligible, in his words &#8212; something like 0.001 percent.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Karine.</p>



<p>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Thanks, everybody.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">(May 16, 2022)</p>



<p>7:34 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; All right, good evening.&nbsp; Happy Monday, everybody.&nbsp; Thank you for joining us on this call tonight to discuss some updates from the administration on efforts to increase the availability of safe infant formula supply across the United States.</p>



<p>As a reminder, this call will be on background, attributable to “senior administration officials.”&nbsp; It will be embargoed until the conclusion of the call.</p>



<p>At the beginning, we have a few brief remarks and then we can just get into a couple of questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Joining us on the call is [senior administration official] and [senior administration official].&nbsp; And with that, I will kick it to [senior administration official].&nbsp;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thanks, Kevin.&nbsp; As you know, getting more safe infant formula onto shelves across the country is one of the President’s top priorities.&nbsp; We understand how stressful it is for parents trying to feed their children &#8212; I say that as someone expecting my second child in June &#8212; and that’s why this administration has been working for weeks to address the infant formula shortage.</p>



<p>It’s important to remember that this shortage exists because one manufacturer, Abbott Nutrition, closed a facility in Michigan due to safety concerns from the FDA.&nbsp; That facility was a major producer of formula that families in this country rely on.&nbsp; And you have heard from us about our ongoing, 24/7 work to tackle the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I want to provide an update tonight on just a couple of very recent developments.&nbsp; First, today, FDA and Abbott agreed on next steps to reopen the Michigan plant that is currently closed.&nbsp; This is a critical step in resolving the shortages that are impacting families across the country today.</p>



<p>Abbott and the federal government signed a formal consent decree that outlines the steps to get the facility reopened and produce &#8212; and producing formula again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The consent decree requires that Abbott retain an independent expert to review the facility’s operation and ensure compliance with the law.&nbsp; It includes requirements for testing products and for promptly notifying the FDA should any contamination be detected.</p>



<p>And the consent decree also requires the implementation of a detailed sanitation plan, an environmental monitoring plan, a new employee training program.&nbsp; So a robust document outlining a key series of basic steps that the parties have agreed to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, also today, we took another important step with the FDA releasing guidance under which major formula manufacturers can ask to safely import formula that is not currently being produced for the U.S. market.</p>



<p>Companies will need to apply with the FDA, and FDA is prepared to review applications quickly and respond to them rapidly.&nbsp; FDA will prioritize review of applications that are most likely to be successful and will get the most formula to U.S. shelves as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>FDA is going to be closely evaluating quality and safety and safety history to ensure that only safe product will come to American shelves.</p>



<p>At the White House, we have alerted embassies and retailers and manufacturers to identify potential companies that could make use of the new importation process.&nbsp; And we’ll continue working with folks as we get this process moving.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Third, I want to highlight that throughout the weekend we’ve been working closely with manufacturers and retailers that are today producing formula for the U.S. market to identify transportation and logistical needs to increase the amount and speed of approved formula that’s being shipped into the country, and to ensure that formula that is being produced here or coming in from abroad is quickly moving from factories to retailers.&nbsp; And we’ve offered logistical support, and we’ll be, you know, continuing to conduct that outreach and identify ways to be helpful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fourth, we’ve also continued to engage with pediatricians and parents’ groups and other stakeholders to hear from them and to share information about resources and (inaudible) during this time.</p>



<p>So, taken together, the steps we&#8217;re announcing today should continue to make a difference for families.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll be working overtime to get more formula on shelves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, with that, back to you, Kevin.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Don&#8217;t be shy &#8212; if you have questions, we have some time.&nbsp; First let&#8217;s go to Spencer Kimball at CNBC.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thank you for doing the call.&nbsp; So the FDA said that, you know, it streamlined the process at ports, and imports have increased 300 percent since last year.&nbsp; Can you just say where exactly are the imports coming from &#8212; what companies, what countries?&nbsp; How long does the administration expect the situation to take until supply is kind of normalized?</p>



<p>And then also, in the consent decree, the Justice Department said that products were adulterated.&nbsp; Abbott has denied that.&nbsp; So did the FDA find contaminated baby powder at the facility?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; [Senior administration official], you want to take the first part of that?&nbsp;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So I can take the piece on the consent decree.&nbsp; So, you know, I don&#8217;t want to get into a, like, huge back-and-forth on exactly the findings of facts between the agencies or between the parties here.</p>



<p>The consent decree reflects that there was a history of, you know, product disposal at the facility because of concerns about contamination, and so it&#8217;s consistent with that.&nbsp; But I would refer you to DOJ and to Abbott for, you know, specifics on the terms of the consent decree.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Senior administration official], if you can jump in.&nbsp; I think you&#8217;re best positioned to weigh in on where are you seeing imports are coming from.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; And if not, I will (inaudible).</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; No, it&#8217;s working now.&nbsp; I had trouble unmuting my line, so apologies for that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, when we look at our trade data, the sources of imports for formula currently include Ireland, Chile, the Netherlands.&nbsp; You know, as we look at the kind of countries that have health and safety inspection systems similar to our own, may be able to meet that quantity and labeling and nutritional guidance standards that [senior administration official] laid out, we can imagine Australia, New Zealand, the UK also being countries that, you know, product could be imported from.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Next question.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Alex Alper at Reuters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi there.&nbsp; Can you hear me okay?</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Yep.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; We can.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, great.&nbsp; I guess &#8212; you know, you mentioned the importance of facilitating transportation.&nbsp; And I was wondering if you could say, you know, what specific transportation help has the White House offered to the companies involved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, just to follow up on something that was mentioned I think late last week, which was the possibility of invoking the DPA.&nbsp; And I wondered if that was still under consideration and how specifically it could help increase production.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; On the &#8212; I can take those questions.</p>



<p>On the transportation side, you know, we&#8217;ve talked to the retailers, we&#8217;ve talked to the manufacturers.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve told them, “Let us know if you&#8217;re having some specific transportation, logistical challenges somewhere in your supply chain where we could offer some help.”&nbsp; Thus far, we&#8217;re still working through those requests, and I have no specific update to report on that side.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we have seen generally during this supply chain crisis &#8212; because we have a Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force that the administration has been running &#8212; that, in some instances, we’re able to help improve communication between all the firms and the logistics industry, and between suppliers and their customers to help speed up the movement of goods through the supply chain.</p>



<p>On the question of the Defense Production Act, here we are continuing to focus on actions we can take to get more supply available as quickly as possible.&nbsp; That is, like, our primary goal.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to continue to look at every option that is on the table there.&nbsp; No additional specific updates to offer you on the DPA there, but I will point you again to the work that the FDA has done today with their new importation guidance.&nbsp; It’s is a really critical and crucial step to quickly increasing supply in the country.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Let’s go to MJ Lee at CNN.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, can you hear me?&nbsp; Sorry about that.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Hey.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, thank you so much for doing this.&nbsp; I was wondering if you all could share or know when the last time was that the FDA inspected the Michigan facility that&#8217;s opening up again.&nbsp; And will FDA officials be there throughout the reopening process?&nbsp; And just if you could walk us through how that would work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then just on the new guidance you mentioned for applying to import formula, you said that you hope to go through some of these applications pretty quickly.&nbsp; Do you have a sense of a general timeline for that?&nbsp; Are we talking about days or weeks for approval?&nbsp; And also just what the quantity is that you are estimating.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, so on the first question, I would refer you to the FDA.&nbsp; As you know, they&#8217;re an independent scientific entity that conducts, you know, independent inspections and enforcement activities.&nbsp; So I would refer you to them for details on what they can share about when they have been on site and, you know, the schedule there.</p>



<p>On the timing for reviewing applications, FDA, you know, has asked companies to provide them with information that they can review.&nbsp; FDA has made clear that they will prioritize applications that stand a good chance of being successful, that indicate, sort of, clear quality and safety and nutritional adequacy and all of that, and that have potential to move significant products into the United States quickly.</p>



<p>You know, we expect &#8212; well, the process has been designed to move rapidly so that FDA, again, can evaluate those applications that have a clearer chance of success and move forward on those on those quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I don&#8217;t have a specific timeline or number of days to give you tonight.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Next question, let&#8217;s go to Alyssa Rosenberg, The Washington Post.</p>



<p>All right, Alyssa, we will come back to you.&nbsp;<br><br>Ben Gittleson, ABC.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Along the same lines, I was wondering how soon you expect imports could be actually seen on shelves.&nbsp; I know the previous question was about the application process, but as you&#8217;re planning for supply to become available, if you could give an estimate for parents how long it would take for the imports to actually appear on shelves.&nbsp;<br><br>And then also, the White House had said earlier today that the administration had been contacting suppliers for infant formula manufacturers to let them know that their materials were critical for boosting production, and encouraging them to prioritize the production and delivery.&nbsp; I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more specific detail.&nbsp; Like, what does that actually look like?&nbsp; Are these suppliers within the U.S.?&nbsp; What type of impact will this make and how quickly?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, sure.&nbsp; On the first question, the FDA commissioner said this morning that we are talking about getting products to the shelves in, you know, a matter of weeks.&nbsp; So we&#8217;re talking just a couple of weeks to &#8212; you know, for &#8212; to get some of that imported product into the country and available in U.S. stores.<br><br>I’ll turn to [senior administration official] on the second piece.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; So, on the second one, you know, I can tell you broadly: You can imagine that a manufacturer of infant formula needs to assemble a range of inputs, whether it&#8217;s specific ingredients, it’s labeling, it’s packaging materials.&nbsp; And so, you know, in a few instances, they identified how it would be helpful to get some of those supplies in quicker, and we were able to contact the suppliers and let them know.&nbsp; And they were &#8212; it was a helpful flag because they were not aware of what that downstream customer was producing and were eager to help make sure that those orders were being sent quickly.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go back to Alyssa.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, sorry about that.&nbsp; So, I &#8212; you know, I just hopped off the FDA call.&nbsp; I&#8217;m hearing from you guys, from them that it&#8217;s going to be a couple of weeks.&nbsp; And what efforts are underway to connect families who can&#8217;t get formula now with the formula they need?&nbsp; Because, clearly, there are families who can&#8217;t wait a couple of weeks.<br><br>I know that, you know, the guidance has referenced trying to identify areas where out-of-stock rates are particularly high and expedite getting formula to retailers there.&nbsp; But can you talk about any resources and efforts that are helping families bridge that couple-of-weeks gap, especially because it could be longer?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; So, I mean, as you know, we are carefully monitoring data across the country and improving, you know, our ability to understand regional and other variations every minute.&nbsp; As we relayed last week and remains true, we do know that today there is more infant formula coming off of production lines in the U.S. than there was prior to the recall.&nbsp; And similarly, overall sales of infant formula are up 13 percent compared to the pre-recall period.&nbsp;<br><br>So there is infant formula available.&nbsp; At the same time, we are absolutely mindful of how challenging this is, and I think we have a couple of key messages for families.<br><br>One is we want families to talk to their pediatrician and have confidence that it is &#8212; it is generally safe to switch your baby between infant formula products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If there is a brand available in the store &#8212; even if it&#8217;s not your normal product or, you know, a slightly different formulation or a different brand or, you know, powder versus liquid or, you know, any of those differences &#8212; it is &#8212; the formula on U.S. shelves is safe, and it is safe to move your baby between products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We recognize that that&#8217;s scary and can be challenging, but families should have confidence buying whatever is available and providing that to their family.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, you know, it is not &#8212; it is not safe to provide &#8212; to water down formula or to make your own infant formula at home.&nbsp; And so, we think it is important that families hear those messages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:  All right.  Last question, let&#8217;s go to Meredith Lee.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi there.&nbsp; Can you hear me?</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering if you could just clarify the timeline for when FDA notified the White House about infant formula shortages at the Michigan plant and potential market disruptions from that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know Karine said today that the administration has been working on this 24/7 since February, but Politico reported that a whistleblower last October flagged food safety concerns to senior FDA officials.&nbsp; So I&#8217;m wondering when the FDA notified the White House about any issues at the Michigan plant and potential shortages stemming from that.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Yeah, I &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to &#8212; I&#8217;m not in a position to comment on any internal communication.&nbsp; The recall became public on February 17th.&nbsp; And, you know, we certainly have been very public about our activity in this space since then.&nbsp; But again, I am &#8212; I am not in a position to comment on internal communications that were &#8212; you know, that would have happened prior to that.</p>



<p>MR. MUNOZ:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Well, thank you, everybody.&nbsp; As a reminder, the call is on background, attributable to “senior administration officials,” and the embargo lifts after this.&nbsp; So, thank you for joining tonight.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(May 16, 2022)</p>



<p>6:36 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Hello, everyone.&nbsp; Thank you so much for calling in this evening.&nbsp; I know it&#8217;s late, so I won&#8217;t delay and get us started.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of note, this is a call that&#8217;s on background.&nbsp; So for just your own edification, we have [senior administration official], who is [redacted].&nbsp; And we also have [senior administration official] &#8212; and I apologize if I misspelled her name.&nbsp; And she is also joining us for this call.&nbsp; For both of them, please use a “senior administration official” when you refer to them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This call is embargoed until &#8212; at its conclusion, and I will let you know at the end of the call.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t get a question, but you want to answer one after the fact, feel free to contact me or State Department and we will assist you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And with that, I will turn it over to you, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, [moderator].&nbsp; So good afternoon, everybody.&nbsp; And thanks again for jumping on the line.</p>



<p>Today we&#8217;re &#8212; the United States announced a series of measures to increase support for the Cuban people and safeguard our national security interests. </p>



<p>I&#8217;ll say that this is the result of work we&#8217;ve been doing over the last year as a part of the policy review of our Cuba policy.&nbsp; It continues to center on human rights and empowering the Cuban people to determine their own future, and we continue to call on the Cuban government to release all political prisoners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before jumping in, I want to just very quickly review some of the actions that we&#8217;ve been taking since the large-scale protests that took place last July.&nbsp; The President met with the Cuban American community and directed us &#8212; following that meeting &#8212; to take action in two primary areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first is to promote accountability for human rights abuses, for which we have announced several rounds of sanctions targeting those individuals and entities with direct ties to human rights abuses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, he directed us to explore meaningful ways to support the Cuban people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, since then, we&#8217;ve prioritized facil- &#8212; prioritized and facilitated the export of privately sourced or donated goods to the Cuban people, focusing specifically on agricultural and medical exports; facilitated U.S. private sector faith-based organizations and other NGOs to provide humanitarian support; provided guidance to individuals and entities seeking to export to Cuba for the first time; also increased our support for the families of those who were detained; and increased, by $5 million, our support for censorship circumvention technology to support the ability of the Cuban people to communicate to, from, and among each other. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, the measures today, again, are practical steps that we&#8217;re taking to address the humanitarian situation and to respond to the needs of the Cuban people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>President Biden is also fulfilling his commitment to the Cuban American community and their family members in Cuba by announcing measures in four key areas, which we plan to implement in the coming weeks &#8212; these measures &#8212; willing to support greater freedom and expand economic opportunities for the Cuban people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, diving in, the four areas are: First, we&#8217;re going to reinstate the Cuba Family Reunification Parole Program and continue to increase the capacity for consular services.&nbsp; So as you all saw, we began &#8212; resumed limited immigrant visa processing in early May and are looking to make sure that we staff up so that we can begin processing the full 20,000 immigrant visas out of Havana as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, we will &#8212; we&#8217;re strengthening family ties and facilitating educational connections for American and Cuban people by expanding authorized travel.&nbsp; And on that, I’ll say specifically authorizing commercial and charter flights to locations beyond Havana.&nbsp; We are reinstating group people-to-people educational travel under a general license, among a number of other measures.&nbsp; We are not reinstating individual people-to-people educational travel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Third, we are increasing support for independent Cuban entrepreneurs.&nbsp; That includes encouraging commercial opportunities outside the state sector by using their access &#8212; independent Cuban entrepreneurs’ access to the Internet, cloud technology, programming interfaces, e-commerce platforms, and a number of other measures, including access to microfinance and training.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then lastly, we will ensure that remittances flow more freely to the Cuban people while not enriching those who perpetrate human rights abuses.&nbsp; And by that, I mean we are removing the limit on family remittances of $1,000 per quarter per sender/receiver pair.&nbsp; And we’ll authorize donative remittances, which will support Cuban families and independent Cuban entrepreneurs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donative remittances will particularly be crucial in supporting the Afro-Cuban community on the island.&nbsp; And I will note that right now only one of six Afro-Cubans receives family remittances.&nbsp; We will not remove entities from the Cuba restricted list, so remittances through FINCIMEX will remain prohibited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most importantly, we&#8217;re going to continue to elevate the matter of human rights, the treatment of political prisoners, and in particular, we’re going to elevate the issue of labor rights in Cuba as something that &#8212; the issue of labor rights, in general, is something that is a core priority for the Biden-Harris administration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, I will now defer to my colleague, who is a versed expert on all the details here, to add additional points.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, [senior administration official].&nbsp; Nothing for me at the top, but I&#8217;m happy to answer questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thank you so much for doing this.&nbsp; I do have a &#8212; I just have a quick question about Senator Menendez, who just released a statement saying that the announcement today “risks sending the wrong message.”&nbsp; And he says he&#8217;s dismayed to learn that the administration will authorize group travel to Cuba.&nbsp; Do you have any reaction?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, I mean, what I&#8217;ll say &#8212; and I&#8217;ll allow my colleague to weigh in on this &#8212; is that, certainly, the senator’s concerns about establishing the group people-to-people travel under general license opens the door to tourism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We &#8212; I think one thing to underscore is that the Treasury Department has the authority to audit groups that are organizing travel.&nbsp; And we will ensure that that travel is purposeful and in accordance with U.S. law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Senior administration official], I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s anything else you want to add to that.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; We’ll certainly ensure travel is purposeful and in accordance with U.S. law.&nbsp; And we’ll note something that President Biden had said often, which is his belief that Americans are the best ambassadors for democratic values.&nbsp; And facilitating group people-to-people travel will allow for greater engagement between the American people and the promotion of their democratic values.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I wonder if you&#8217;ve reached a decision yet about the Summit of the Americas and whether Cuba will be invited.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So what I&#8217;ll say on that is &#8212; Karen &#8212; is we&#8217;ve not made &#8212; invitations have not gone out, so there&#8217;s not been a decision on that.&nbsp; This &#8212; and these policy measures, as I mentioned, have been long in the works, as you well know, and are seen as completely separate from the conversation of who attends and does not attend the summit.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, thank you very much.&nbsp; I think that &#8212; that was my &#8212; my question was the relationship between this process and the Summit of the Americas, and whether &#8212; for the countries that have expressed concern about attending the summit in the absence of a Cuban invitation, whether that timing is in any way related to the announcement you&#8217;re making today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp;&nbsp; No, so the &#8212; I mean, this was always planned for what we&#8217;re doing.&nbsp; It’s a coincidence.&nbsp; But I would say that in the conversations we&#8217;ve had with other leaders, we have laid out also just the level of ambition of the summit agenda as really where the focus should be.&nbsp; And I think the large majority of interlocutors &#8212; and something where Senator Chris Dodd, as special advisor for the summit, has been very active &#8212; I think agree that we should be focusing on addressing a whole host of shared challenges in the region and not blow up the summit over who shows up and who doesn&#8217;t.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; Thank you for doing this.&nbsp; My question goes back to the question before.&nbsp; Why are these changes being announced now?&nbsp; I mean, you say this it’s coincidental, but are these concessions to the Cuban government for the boycott on the Summit of the America?&nbsp; That’s something that people on Capitol Hill actually say right now.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, I don’t &#8212; I don’t know what “on the Hill” you’re referring to.&nbsp; But, again, these are actions that we see as in the national interest of the United States.&nbsp; They are focused, they’re practical steps we are taking to find ways to expand support for the Cuban people and to do what all Cuban Americans have been asking for, which is for us to reestablish immigrant visa processing in Havana.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know if, [senior administration official], if there&#8217;s anything else you want to add?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; It&#8217;s a time of concerning &#8212; the humanitarian situation in Cuba right now is very concerning.&nbsp; And as the President directed us to find ways to meaningfully support the Cuban people, we assessed that these measures do take steps to do so at a particularly concerning time.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thank you very much for this.&nbsp; I really appreciate it.&nbsp; We know that on the campaign trail President Biden had referred to Trump&#8217;s policies as “failed” and wanted to reverse them.&nbsp; Is this going in the step of reversing what many have seen as a maximum-pressure-style campaign against Cuba?&nbsp; And can we expect more measures such as closer &#8212; closer relations in terms of normalization of relations?&nbsp; Could this move forward based on the reaction from the Cuban side and their attitude moving forward?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Well, look, I &#8212; thanks for that question.&nbsp; Again, these &#8212; these are steps that, as my colleague mentioned, are intended to help alleviate the humanitarian suffering that prompts out (inaudible) migration from Cuba and also to advance our interest in supporting the Cuban people and ensuring that Cuban Americans and Americans in general are also the best advanced ambassadors for U.S. policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, measures are ones that are a complement to what has been an active effort since July of last year to increase the pressure on human rights abuses in Cuba and to find ways to provide more direct humanitarian support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And again, the President&#8217;s direction has been to find ways to hold the regime accountable and to support the Cuban people.&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&#8217;s been what has informed this policy outcome.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Thank you very much for doing this.&nbsp; I have actually two questions.&nbsp; The first is: Why keep Guyana processing the visas?&nbsp; Why not change everything coming back to Havana?&nbsp; What is impeding you &#8212; impeaching you to do so?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the second question is: Do you have any plans to change the five-year visa that was before, during the administration &#8212; during the Obama administration?&nbsp; I understand now it&#8217;s only one way.&nbsp; Before that, it was multiple ways for five years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; [Senior administration official], do you want to take that?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; At this time, we plan to process immigrant visas &#8212; many immigrant visas out of Georgetown, Guyana, while we are standing up limited immigrant visa processing in Havana.&nbsp; We intend to resume in short order the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program out of Havana as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the reason we are continuing to process visas out of Guyana is to maximize capacity.&nbsp; We are slowly ramping up capacity in Havana.&nbsp; And as we do so, we do not want to diminish the overall numbers of interviews that we can conduct, and so we&#8217;ll keep the Georgetown option open.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And with respect to the question on visa validity for B visas, I do not have anything to share at this time.</p>



<p><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, thanks.&nbsp; Thanks very much for doing this.&nbsp; In 2017, the Trump administration scaled back our presence in Havana.&nbsp; And as you just said, we&#8217;re going to be increasing our presence.&nbsp; We scaled it back because of concerns about Havana Syndrome.&nbsp; And I was curious what exactly has changed that makes you feel confident that you could put more people in the embassy there.&nbsp;<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; [Senior administration official], you want to take that?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; The President directed us to increase staff at Embassy Havana &#8212; at U.S. Embassy Havana and to do so with an appropriate security posture.&nbsp;<br><br>We have been working over the course of the last several months to put in place a plan to be able to do so.&nbsp; As you know, the top priority of the U.S. government, and Secretary Blinken has said this several times, is the safety and security of U.S. personnel overseas.&nbsp; And we are working closely with all the relevant bureaus in the Department of State and across the interagency as well on plans to investigate and get to the bottom of the anomalous health incidents.&nbsp; And then as we do so, we working to increase staff as an appropriate security posture at U.S. Embassy Havana.</p>



<p><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks very much.&nbsp; Two quick questions.&nbsp; First, just following up on that last one: While you haven&#8217;t come to a conclusion about Havana Syndrome, are you now persuaded that the Cuban government was not responsible?&nbsp;<br><br>And more to the question of the sanctions relief here: Take us a little bit into the logic of not going back to the kind of sanctions relief that the Obama administration, or I should say Obama-Biden administration, had in place at the end of their time in office.&nbsp; And what are you getting from the leverage of holding back on some of the sanctions relief?</p>



<p><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Well, look, I&#8217;ll answer the second part and then defer to my colleague on the first part.&nbsp; Look, I think, fundamentally, these policies are ones that are designed to advance our own national interests and U.S. national security policy, specifically expanding the ability to process visas outside Havana.&nbsp; And the other is very specific steps and &#8212; specific and practical steps to create bridges to the Cuban people.<br><br>I think that what we&#8217;re going to be doing over the next several months is focusing on implementing these steps and which &#8212; you know, some of which are going to take place faster than others.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to monitor the situation in Cuba and the effects of our actions.&nbsp;<br><br>But I&#8217;ll say that the crackdown by the Cuban regime after the July 11th protests were there for, I think, the world to see.&nbsp; And the sentences that were imposed on people that were just singing in the streets and asking for food and to have a greater say in the future of their country really shows the situation &#8212; the lack of respect for human rights on the island.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s something that is at the core of President Biden&#8217;s approach to the Americas and, frankly, the world.<br><br>But these are steps that we thought were designed to get specifically to the Cuban people and that were in our unilateral interest.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; And with respect to your question about the anomalous health incidents, I&#8217;ll say that we are working across the interagency and State Department and with allies around the world as well to get to the bottom of the anomalous health incidents.&nbsp; And at this moment, we do not have a conclusion as to the attribution.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Inaudible) much for doing this.&nbsp; I was hoping you could say when do you anticipate the invites for the summit to go out.&nbsp; And while I&#8217;m just considering this is one of the few times we&#8217;ll probably get to ask you questions about this &#8212; you know, this &#8212; you know, on this (inaudible) &#8212; can you talk any &#8212; a little bit about what goes into making the decisions of who to invite; you know, what are the factors that are being considered?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; So, I guess the plan is to send the invitations soon.&nbsp; And the &#8212; I guess the rationale is, look, the host has wide discretion.&nbsp; And we’ll &#8212; but we start by looking at the Inter-American Democratic Charter and the criteria that it established for inviting leaders from democratically elected governments.</p>



<p>I think the question of expanding that is one where we consult with our partners in the region.&nbsp; We have these debates about who to invite, but ultimately it is the prerogative of the host to make that decision.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, good afternoon.&nbsp; So I have specific questions on the measures.&nbsp; First, do you have a timeline for when you expect the embassy in Havana to be working at full capacity where you think you&#8217;ll be meeting the 20,000 visa quota agreed with the Cuban government?&nbsp; That&#8217;s one.</p>



<p>The other: You say the authorizing of commercial and charter flights.&nbsp; So you expect that the frequencies that were available before the sanctions will be available again?&nbsp; And you said cities different from Havana.</p>



<p>And on the remittances: So you&#8217;re lifting their limit on 1,000 percent [sic] per quarter, but you&#8217;re not excluding the Cuban entity.&nbsp; So how are people going to send the money?&nbsp; And how will this specific measure benefit Afro-Cubans?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Would you like to take to the first question?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; And forgive me, can you repeat the first question?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How quickly are we going to get up to 20,000 in Havana?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Oh, perfect.&nbsp; I do not have a timeframe at this time, unfortunately.&nbsp; We are working with our colleagues in the State Department and also Department of Homeland Security, which manages the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program, to determine the pace at which we can increase capacity and visa issuance and parole practicing.</p>



<p>We aim to, and have every intent to, be in compliance with the migration accords.&nbsp; And the recent migration talks that were held last month between the United States and Cuba sought to bring both countries into compliance with their commitments for safe, legal, and orderly migration as enshrined in the migration accords.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; On your second question is &#8212; so the implementation of these measures, I think we&#8217;re going to be working to move very quickly to execute on them over the course of weeks and months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And when it comes to the question of visa (inaudible) or of remittance processing, certainly providing reassurance to third, kind of, electronic payment companies that there is bipartisan support for electronic payments &#8212; that is something that&#8217;s going to take time but it&#8217;s something we&#8217;re going to focus a lot on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On not removing FINCIMEX from the Cuba restricted list: Cuba is unique in the world at having the military play a role in remittance processing.&nbsp; If they were &#8212; you know, and we&#8217;ve engaged with them to underscore that if there was a civilian entity that could do the processing, that that would be something that would be acceptable, recognizing that what we want to work toward is having electronic payments expand to the extent that that&#8217;s possible.</p>



<p>So the decisions &#8212; the ball is in their court to decide.</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; All right, everybody.&nbsp; Well, that was the last question.&nbsp; Thank you so much for attending again.&nbsp; Remember, this is a call on background, attributed to “senior administration officials.”&nbsp; And the embargo is now lifted.</p>



<p>Thank you so much.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>On the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, Jill and I stand in support and solidarity with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex, (LGBTQI+) people in the United States and around the world. And we join with Americans across the country to reaffirm our commitment to the ongoing work of upholding human dignity for all people and advancing equality globally.</p>



<p>On this day in 1990, the World Health Organization took the long overdue step of declassifying ‘homosexuality’ as a mental disorder. Since that time, there has been much progress. But we continue to witness disturbing setbacks and rising hate and violence targeting LGBTQI+ people in the United States and around the world. This is wrong. LGBTQI+ people are entitled to all the rights, opportunities, and protections that belong to every human on this planet. LGBTQI+ people are an essential part of families and communities—teachers, first responders, public officials, doctors, lawyers, front-line workers, and friends who enrich and strengthen every single country.</p>



<p>And make no mistake: hateful legislative attacks against members of our own LGBTQI+ community cannot be tolerated in America or anywhere else. They spur discrimination and can stoke violence. And they are rooted in the same ignorance and intolerance that we see around the world. Hate is hate—and all of us have a responsibility to speak out against hate wherever we find it.</p>



<p>The United States leads the world not only by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. That means making commitments— and following through with action, transparency, and accountability. That’s why, last month, we released the first-ever public progress <a href="https://www.state.gov/lgbtqi-human-rights/">report</a> on my Administration’s whole-of-government approach to advance the human rights of LGBTQI+ people globally, from supporting local civil society organizations to standing up for LGBTQI+ human rights at the United Nations, and in our engagement with repressive governments.</p>



<p>By openly reporting on our own progress, the United States hopes to inspire other governments to take similar action to address the needs of their LGBTQI+ communities.</p>



<p>Strong and healthy democracies must ensure LGBTQI+ people can enjoy full participation in society and access all the benefits available to a nation’s citizens. At the first Summit for Democracy, the United States committed to facilitating the participation and leadership of LGBTQI+ community members in democratic institutions, a process we will continue to support.</p>



<p>To the LGBTQI+ community, my administration sees you. We stand with you. And we will continue to defend human rights and dignity, at home and around the world.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Today, the Biden Administration is announcing that COVIDTests.gov is now open for a third round of ordering. U.S. households are now be able to order an additional eight free at-home tests at COVIDTests.gov—bringing the total number of free tests available to each household since the start of the program to 16. As the highly transmissible subvariants of Omicron drive a rise in cases in parts of the country, free and accessible tests will help slow the spread of the virus.</p>



<p>In January 2022, President Biden committed to making one billion at-home tests available to the American people for free, including half-a-billion available for ordering at COVIDTests.gov. Since then, over 70 million households have visited COVIDTests.gov to order at-home tests to be mailed directly to them. To date, the Administration has delivered approximately 350 million free tests to mailboxes and doorsteps across the country, in U.S. territories, and at overseas military bases, with most tests delivered by the U.S. Postal Service within 48 hours of shipping. The third round of tests available were purchased by the federal government earlier this year with funding from the American Rescue Plan.</p>



<p>People who have difficulty accessing the internet or need additional support placing an order can call 1-800-232-0233 (TTY 1-888-720-7489) to get help in English, Spanish, and more than 150 other languages—8am to midnight ET, 7 days a week. For more information, people can visit: <a href="https://www.covid.gov/tests/faq">https://www.covid.gov/tests/faq</a>.</p>



<p>Since January 2021, the Biden Administration has taken significant action and invested resources provided by Congress to dramatically increase domestic COVID-19 testing manufacturing, the number of tests authorized for use in the U.S., and the number of places where Americans can get a test, as well as to decrease costs for consumers and increase access to free tests.</p>



<p>COVID-19 testing is a critical tool to help mitigate the spread of the virus, which is why maintaining domestic testing capacity is an essential component of the President’s National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan.</p>



<p>Due to Congress’s failure to provide additional funding for the nation’s COVID-19 response, the Administration cannot continue making the types of federal investments needed to sustain domestic testing manufacturing capacity, and this may jeopardize the federal government’s ability to provide free tests moving forward. Today’s announcement underscores the Administration’s commitment to doing everything in our power to ensure the American people have the lifesaving tools they need—so they are prepared for whatever comes. Congress must step up and act as well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">East Room</p>



<p>5:22 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>FIRST LADY BIDEN:&nbsp; Thank you, everyone.&nbsp; Please sit down.&nbsp; And thank you,&nbsp;Your Eminence, for your kind words.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>And welcome, finally, to the Bicentennial Celebration and the very in &#8212; first in-person Greek Heritage event of our administration.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And it’s &#8212; it’s so wonderful to see so many friends with us today.</p>



<p>I’m told that there’s a Greek proverb that says, “A society becomes great when its elder[s] plant trees whose” &#8212; “plant trees whose shade they know they will never enjoy.”</p>



<p>From democracy and philosophy, to astronomy and medicine, to art and literature, the legacy of Greece touches every corner of our culture.&nbsp; We all enjoy the shades of its branches.</p>



<p>And I’ve had the chance to visit Greece many times over the years.&nbsp; And I’ve stood in awe at the history of Athens and the beauty of the islands.&nbsp; And each time, I’ve been welcomed with open arms.</p>



<p>So it’s my pleasure to be able to return that welcome to you, our Greek and Greek American friends.</p>



<p>And I’m especially honored to welcome Prime Minister Mitas- &#8212; Mitsotakis and his wife.&nbsp; And we spent a couple minutes getting to know one another, and it was so nice to get to know you and Sofia and Dafni.&nbsp; You want to stand up and say hello?&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Your work is so inspiring, and I hope that we can continue to deepen our friendship.<br><br>The story of America is the story of all of you.&nbsp; You are a part of our beautiful and rich history.&nbsp; You help write our future every day.&nbsp; And the trees you plant will continue to cover our world.&nbsp; So thank you very much.<br><br>And now, as all of you know, this community has been a true partner to my husband throughout the years, and you mean so much to him.</p>



<p>So please welcome your President, my husband, Joe Biden.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Your Eminence, I’ve been hanging around with the Greek American community for so long, as a Roman Catholic, I bless myself the wrong way.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I find myself going right. &nbsp;I don’t know.&nbsp; I &#8212; the Pope is not real crazy about my change.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br><br>Welcome to the White House.&nbsp; It’s a welco- &#8212; it’s wonderful to be able to host this reception again in person and to welcome the Prime Minister to Washington.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We’ve had good conversations.&nbsp; And I’m delighted to welcome your wife and daughters today as well, because when it comes to Greek American relations, it’s all about family in my experience.&nbsp; As we &#8212; my grandfather Finnegan would say, “That’s the Irish of it.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But I want to welcome Speaker Pelosi.&nbsp; Where are you, Nancy?&nbsp; There you go.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And Paul Pelosi, her husband.<br><br>And to the members of Congress that are here today, including a great many proud Greek Americans that are here with us today.&nbsp;<br><br>And if you will excuse a point of personal privilege, I’d like to introduce John Sarbanes.&nbsp; I want you to know how much we all are thinking about and missing your dad today.&nbsp; Every day.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; His dad was an enormous influence on me and educated me a lot when I got here as a 30-year-old kid in the United States &#8212;<br><br>FIRST LADY BIDEN:&nbsp; And his mom.<br><br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Oh, his mom is there.<br><br>FIRST LADY BIDEN:&nbsp; No &#8212; and missing his mom, too.&nbsp;<br><br>PRESIDENT BIDEN:&nbsp; Oh, yes.&nbsp; Excuse me.&nbsp; And missing your mom as well.&nbsp; But your dad really took me school, and I appreciate it.<br><br>And, Your Eminence, it’s great to get to honor and see you again.&nbsp; What an honor it is.&nbsp; And I want to thank you for your moral leadership and all of the work the Greek Archdiocese of America is doing to shine a light in the world.&nbsp;<br><br>And last year, we had to commemorate the bicentennial of independence virtually because of the pandemic.<br><br>And, by the way, I want to thank the proud Greek Americans who are on the forefront of the fight against COVID-19 and our efforts to vaccinate the world.<br><br>Last year, we celebrated two hundred &#8212; this year, we celebrate 201 years, the end of a year of bicentennial celebrations.&nbsp; And it’s an opportunity to honor the history of our two nations and peoples and how we share so much together &#8212; a chance to look to the future that we’re going to build together.<br><br>I’m incredibly proud the first year of my presidency was able to be the first year of the next 100 years of relations between Greece and the United States of America.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)<br><br>It’s no exaggeration to say that today our friendship and partnership and our alliance is closer and stronger than it has ever been.&nbsp; We had a great conversation.&nbsp; and the dangerous part for you all is we like one another a lot.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br><br>Our two nations are working together across the board on climate and energy, on trade and investment, on defense and disaster response, and so much more.<br><br>And our new Ambassador to Greece, George Tsunis, a proud Greek American, is with us today.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I’m not sure if I was prouder to be elected president or George to be named ambassador, which he was.&nbsp; But George &#8212; thank you, pal &#8212; has just taken up his post in Athens to continue carrying forward this important work.<br><br>And, Prime Minister, I think there is no area as vital for Greece and the United States to stand together than in the defense of our shared and diplomatic principles and our democratic systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The United States and the world owe a debt to the ancient Greek ideas that first taught us that “we the people” and the “demos,” our democracy, can control our own destiny.&nbsp; And you made us believe it.&nbsp; And the idea that has endured for a millennia.&nbsp; But it’s also an idea that every generation has had to fight to uphold.<br><br>Every generation has had to defeat democracy’s mortal foes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because in our imperfect world, the appetites and ambitions of the few forever seek to dominate the lives and liberties of the many.<br><br>And, sadly, we have both discussed, including at the Summit for Democracies last year, that democracy is more under assault today than &#8212; including in the United States &#8212; than any time in the recent past.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But the Greek people know, just as the American people do, that freedom and democracy are worth sacrificing for.&nbsp; Just as the ideals of the ancient Athenians inspired America’s founders, the American Revolution, I’m presumptuous to say, helped inspire Greek patriots to fight for their own independence over 201 years ago.&nbsp;<br><br>And Greece remembers that when dictators and strongmen seek to dominate their neighbors, there is only one answer:<em>Oxi!&nbsp; Oxi!</em>&nbsp; No!&nbsp; No!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>During World War Two, when the Axis forces of fascism were sweeping across Europe, Greece said “no,” inspiring the world through its resistance.<br><br>Today, the war and wisdom and the wanton disinformation have returned to Europe with Russia’s brutal and unprovoked attack on its neighbor, Ukraine.<br><br>We’re seeing horrific atrocities and war crimes, children being buried in mass graves, millions of refugees fleeing Putin’s war, and Greece and the United States standing as one to support the people of Ukraine and impose severe economic costs on Russia to hold Putin accountable.<br><br>And I want to thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for the moral courage &#8212; and I mean it &#8212; the moral courage and clarity you have shown from the very beginning of this crisis: speaking out immediately to condemn Russia’s aggression, welcoming Ukrainian refugees, being a bulwark of security for NATO’s eastern and southeastern Europe and the Mediterranean.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Together, we’re showing the power and the capacity of democracies to be able to act in unison.&nbsp; And we’re helping Ukrainians say “no” to Russian aggression.&nbsp; And we’re saying “no” to tyranny and to the idea that autocracies will outpace democracies in the 21st century, because that’s what is at stake here in my view.&nbsp;<br><br>On a personal note, it’s wonderful to see so many friends here today.&nbsp; Friends like Andy and Mike Manatos &#8212; where are you guys?&nbsp; There you go.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Go back a long way.&nbsp; Who’ve helped with these events over the years since I was a senator and Vice President.&nbsp;<br><br>And Father Alex, who can’t be here today &#8212; I wanted him to know that he’s the reason I bless myself the wrong way.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br><br>And my friend from the University of Delaware, President Dennis Assanis.&nbsp; Where are you, Dennis?&nbsp; There you go.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; The President of the university and his sons, Nicholas and Dimitris.&nbsp; Welcome, gentlemen.&nbsp; It’s great to have you both here.&nbsp;<br><br>I like to joke about being known as “Joe Bidenopolous” in my Greek American community in Delaware.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I only own by 3,100 votes when I ran as a United States senator.&nbsp; And I think we got 92 percent of the Greek vote in Delaware &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; and the nickname stuck.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Small population.&nbsp;<br><br>But the truth is, I’ve been blessed with lifelong friendships and political mentors in the Greek American community.<br><br>I’ve found inspiration in the courage and principled leadership of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, who fought for social justice and from the days &#8212; all the back to the days of Martin Luther King and right through George Floyd.&nbsp; And I thank you.&nbsp; I thank the church.&nbsp;<br><br>As a proud Irish American, I’ve felt a great kinship with the Greek American community.&nbsp; The same values define the way we grew up: courage, decency, honor, treating people with dignity as well as an immense pride in the heart and the heritage of our ancestors that they brought with them to America.<br><br>This is an incredible resilience among Greek Americans.&nbsp; A determination &#8212; a determination to keep going, to keep fighting, no matter the odds &#8212; no matter what.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And there’s no greater symbol of the faithfulness and perseverance of the community than seeing Greek Americans proudly celebrate the reconstitution and re-consecration of the Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church and National Shrine last November in Manhattan.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>The original structure was destroyed more than 20 years ago during the 9/11 terrorist attacks in our &#8212; on our country.&nbsp; And in rebuilding that sacred home of the Greek Orthodox Church and the Greek American community, reaffirmed that even in the deepest, darkest days we always have hope for the future.&nbsp; Always.&nbsp;<br><br>And today, let us tap into that same spirit and rededicate ourselves to all the hard work that lies ahead: to defend democracy in Greece, in the United States, and in all the places where it is under threat today; to stand up to the &#8212; for the dignity and rights of all people.<br><br>My dad used to have expression that everyone, no matter what &#8212; everyone &#8212; and this is not a joke; he would say it all the time &#8212; is entitled to be treated with dignity.&nbsp; Dignity.<br><br>And to renew our commitment to leave our children a world that is more peaceful and more secure and more just than we found it.&nbsp;<br><br>So I want to thank you again, Mr. Prime Minster, for making the trip and for the el- &#8212; the excellent discussions we had today.<br><br>And I look forward to see you again at the NATO Summit very soon in Spain and continuing our close cooperation on behalf of our two nations and all of our shared values.<br><br>But really, Jill and I are looking forward to seeing in Greece as well.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; The floor is yours.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>PRIME MINISTER MITSOTAKIS:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you all so much.</p>



<p>Thank you, Mr. President, Dr. Biden.&nbsp; Ladies and gentlemen, it is really a great privilege to be here with you at this bicentennial celebration.&nbsp; My wife, my daughters, my team, myself are tremendously grateful for the warm reception you have offered us.</p>



<p>And honorable guests, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us here tonight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know this is a very special moment for you, Mr. President.&nbsp; I’m sure you see lots of very good friends amongst this gathering.&nbsp; But this visit, as you pointed out, has very strong historical connotations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Modern Greece, like America before it, was forged in the hands of dreamers, of revolutionaries fighting for freedom, fighting for justice.&nbsp; And it was the story of your independence struggle and its eventual success, coming as it did decades before ours, that inspired the oppressed Greeks to fight against all odds for their own freedom.</p>



<p>The leaders of the Greek revolution drew inspiration from what was achieved on this soil.&nbsp; Our ancestors did not just dream of freedom and self-determination; they fought for democracy, Mr. President &#8212; that elusive government of the people, by the people, for the people, which was invented in ancient Greece 25 centuries ago.</p>



<p>And in his annual message on the 3rd of December, 1822, President James Monroe remarked: “The mention of Greece fills the mind with the most exalted sentiments and arouses in our bosoms the best feelings of which nature is susceptible.”&nbsp; “A strong hope,” he said, “is entertained that these people will recover their independence and resume their equal station among the nations of the earth.”</p>



<p>And it is this shared history of struggle, this shared history of sacrifice that binds our two nations together.&nbsp; It places upon us, as you said, a solemn responsibility to protect and defend the values that our forefathers risked so much to pass on to the next generations.</p>



<p>And today, this duty is more relevant than ever.&nbsp; The war in Ukraine, the invasion of Russia is a chilling reminder that what we took for granted in Europe &#8212; that maps cannot be redrawn by force &#8212; is unfortunately no longer the case.</p>



<p>As you know, Mr. President, we supported Ukraine from the very beginning with humanitarian aid but also with military assistance.</p>



<p>We did so for reasons of principle, which should be painfully obvious, but we did so also to protect a world order that is based on the premise of respect for international law &#8212; what you like to call a “rules-based” international order.</p>



<p>Neo-imperial fantasies belong to other centuries.&nbsp; They must not succeed.&nbsp; And they must not succeed not only for the sake of Ukraine, but to send a very clear signal to other authoritarian leaders that any violation of sovereignty will be met by a unified and a forceful response.</p>



<p>And this is why it is so important that Europe and the United States stand shoulder to shoulder in this fight.&nbsp; After all, what we are protecting are the values which lie at the foundations of our liberal democracies.</p>



<p>And as a Prime Minister of Greece but also as a member of the European Council, I would like to thank you again, Mr. President, for your leadership.</p>



<p>The sanctions we have imposed on Russia are crushing, and rightfully so.&nbsp; But as we discussed, we must not lose sight of the fact that our societies are paying a heavy price in terms of energy prices.&nbsp; And in this respect, there is so much more we can do together, the European Union and the United States, to bring down the prices of energy and, in particular, the price of gas.</p>



<p>And as we reduce our dependence on Russian hydrocarbons, we also need to use our market power as larger purchases of gas to deliver short-term relief to our households and our businesses.</p>



<p>Mr. President, I really mean it when I say that the relationship between Greece and the United States is today at an all-time high.</p>



<p>Last Thursday, our parliament ratified the new defense and cooperation agreement between our two countries.&nbsp; And this new cooperation manifests itself not just in the naval base at Souda Bay, on Crete, which I hope you will have an opportunity to visit.&nbsp; It has been described by many as the jewel in the crown of our fantastic military relationship.&nbsp; But it also manifests itself in the port city of Alexandroupolis in northeastern Greece, just 500 miles from the Ukrainian border.</p>



<p>And apart from its military importance for NATO, Alexandroupoli, as we discussed, is rapidly becoming a regional energy hub, an entry point for liquefied natural gas into the Balkans and Eastern Europe.&nbsp;<br><br>And Greece plans to play an important role as a gateway for electricity produced from cheap, renewable sources, primarily sun, in the Middle East, in Africa.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re very happy, Mr. President, that the U.S. has provided its unequivocal support for these projects.&nbsp;<br><br>A quick word about our region, Mr. President.&nbsp; You are extremely knowledgeable about the Cyprus issue.&nbsp; And please, use all your influence to put the negotiation process back on track in accordance with the U.N. Security Council resolutions.&nbsp; No one &#8212; no one can or will accept a two-state solution in Cyprus.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>The Balkans are also still quite fragile.&nbsp; We must keep the European perspective alive and tangible.&nbsp;<br><br>Greece is a pillar for regional prosperity and security, and we will always seek peaceful ways to resolve our differences with our neighbors.&nbsp; I’m convinced that we can achieve that.<br><br>We gre- &#8212; we place great emphasis on the 3+1 scheme &#8212; a framework that connects the U.S. with Greece, with Cyprus, and with Israel.&nbsp; And at the same time, Mr. President, we will continue to invest in our armed forces and make it very clear that we will not accept any violations of our sovereignty and our sovereign rights.&nbsp; And after all, we&#8217;re doing so in order not just to strengthen Greece, but also in order to strengthen NATO’s southeastern flank.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We will continue our longstanding cooperation between our defense industries.&nbsp; We will launch the process for the acquisition of a squadron of F-35 aircraft, and we do hope to be able to add this fantastic plane to the Greek Air Force before the end of this decade.&nbsp;<br><br>And I&#8217;m happy that on Friday, Lockheed Martin officially expressed its interest in investing in Hellenic aerospace.&nbsp; Of course, the bonds that connect us &#8212; the bonds between America and Greece reach far beyond our shared history, security and defense, and across the board from trade to tourism and technology and cultural exchanges.&nbsp; There is so much, ladies and gentlemen, to be mutually gained.&nbsp;<br><br>As you know, Greece has come through severe adversity.&nbsp; The recent economic crisis was extremely painful for our people.&nbsp; But Greeks have proven their resilience.&nbsp; Democracy in Greece has proven its resilience.&nbsp; And today, Greece bears no comparison to the Greece that became the poster boy of European financial crisis a decade ago.&nbsp;<br><br>Our economy is strong.&nbsp; Earlier this year, we paid off Greece&#8217;s outstanding debt to the IMF two years ahead of schedule.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br><br>We are creating jobs and investing in new industries, such as digital and clean tech.&nbsp; Many European companies, wary of their dependence on China, are bringing back manufacturing jobs to the European continent, and Greece is an obvious candidate to welcome them.&nbsp;<br><br>And many American companies are investing in Greece for the first time &#8212; companies such as Microsoft, Pfizer.&nbsp; They&#8217;re doing so because they see a country that has an advantageous geographic position, that is both a member of NATO and the European Union, a country with a stable government that is welcoming foreign investors.&nbsp;<br><br>Because Greece, Mr. President, is back and a promising future lies ahead of us.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>Let me conclude, Mr. President, by saying that you recognize many Greek American friends amongst this gathering tonight.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve mentioned several of them by name.&nbsp; They call you “Bidenopolous” &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; for a reason, although I suggested that maybe you should be called “Bidenakis.”&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; It would rhyme well.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure everyone in this audience is particularly proud today.&nbsp; I’m equally proud about what Greek Americans have achieved in the United States.&nbsp; Let me especially acknowledge the presence of your new ambassador to Greece, George Tsunis.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>I met him at my office a few days ago.&nbsp; The first thing he told me was a story of his parents leaving a small village in western Greece called Platanos.&nbsp; We&#8217;re honored to welcome George back to his second homeland.</p>



<p>And, Mr. President, marking this bicentennial, albeit with a year&#8217;s delay due to COVID, matters deeply to the Greek people and to me personally.</p>



<p>Recent events make this celebration that much more pertinent.&nbsp; The fight of democracies against autocracies is a defining battle of our generation.&nbsp; And the proumo- &#8212; the proud moments from the history of our two nations give us confidence in what we can achieve in the future.</p>



<p>We should never lose sight of what our ancestors fought for and that which we must now defend.&nbsp; All of us should draw great strength from their example.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m hugely grateful to you, Mr. President, and Dr. Biden for hosting this magnificent gathering.&nbsp; And I took your word very seriously that you do intend to visit Greece &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; to reciprocate this visit.</p>



<p>Thank you again, all, very much.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>FIRST LADY BIDEN:&nbsp; You know, my husband has always told me that all politics is personal.&nbsp; And I think that you can see that in the relationship that Joe has with the Prime Minister.&nbsp; And Mareva and I are already making plans to see how we can work together.</p>



<p>And talking about, you know, personal relationships, I want to thank each and every one of you for the relationships that we’ve formed with all of you and the support that you’ve given us.</p>



<p>So, please enjoy the People’s House with food and drink and music.&nbsp; So, we look forward to saying hello.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>
