<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks everyone for joining us.&nbsp; We’re going to just do a quick call to preview the Monday meeting of the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council.&nbsp; We’re just going to walk through what we’re expecting in the meeting and just some of the outcomes that will come out of it.&nbsp; We’re going to have more to say on the outcomes on Monday itself.</p>



<p>As a reminder, this call is on background, attributable to &#8220;senior administration officials.&#8221;&nbsp; The contents of this call are embargoed until this Sunday, 11 p.m.&nbsp; Eastern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For your awareness and not for reporting, our speakers on the call are [senior administration officials].&nbsp; So again, that was just for your awareness and not for reporting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re going to do some remarks at the top and then try to take as many questions as we can.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I’m going to kick it over to [senior administration official] to get us started.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks very much, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.&nbsp; As you all might remember, last June at the U.S.-EU Summit, President Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel established the U.S. and EU Trade and Technology Council.&nbsp; The U.S.-EU TTC, as we call it, will have its second ministerial meeting, as [senior administration official] mentioned, in Saclay, a technology hub near Paris on May 15th and 16th.&nbsp; The inaugural meeting, as many of you know, was held in Pittsburgh at the end of September last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the co-chairs, just to remind everybody, are Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, and EU co-chairs, European Commission Executive Vice Presidents Margrethe Vestage and Valdis Dombrovskis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, we made a lot of progress, I think, at the Pittsburgh meeting, including working towards common principles to update the rules of the road for a 21st century economy and technology ecosystem, including addressing non-market trade practices, enhancing cooperation on semiconductors and supply chains, exchanging information on investment trends that impact our security, shared principles on export control cooperation and developing and implementing technologies like artificial intelligence in accordance with our shared democratic values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, in addition to all of that work that had been staked out at Pittsburgh, as you all are well aware, the TTC, I think, really laid the foundation for the really unprecedented cooperation on sanctions and export controls that you’ve seen in response to Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, at this upcoming meeting on Monday, the U.S. and EU co-chairs will review the progress we’ve been making and really the deep cooperation over the last six months, both by the working groups and all of the additional cooperation that spawned and will work to advance action on our transatlantic cooperation agenda with respect to democratic approaches to trade, technology, and innovation.&nbsp; And in addition, the co-chairs will be meeting with a range of U.S. and EU stakeholders to hear out their views on the past and future work of the TTC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, with that, I’ll hand it over to my colleague.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks, and thanks everyone for joining us on this call today.&nbsp; We’re all tremendously excited about the second meeting of the TTC and really see it as a key opportunity to drive further cooperation across the Atlantic on a whole range of global trade and technology issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think over the last six months, as [senior administration official] says, we really have been able to drive close and enduring ties between the U.S. and the European Union.&nbsp; We’ve strengthened, deepened, and elevated our relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And to give just a couple of examples of the kinds of things we’ve accomplished just over the last six months.&nbsp; Between the last TTC and this one, we’ve been able to resolve our disagreement over tariffs on steel trade, reaching an agreement with the European Union on steel trade.&nbsp; We also just earlier this year reached an agreement in principle on a new transatlantic data privacy framework to create legal certainty for transatlantic data flows.&nbsp; And then of course, as [senior administration official] mentioned, I think there’s been an unprecedented level of cooperation on sanctions and export control measures as part of our coordinated overall response to President Putin’s war on Ukraine.</p>



<p>I think on Sunday evening and Monday at the second meeting of the TTC, you’re going to see us deepen this partnership and announce a number of key outcomes, including deeper information sharing on exports of critical U.S. and EU technology, commitment to develop a joint roadmap on evaluation and measurement tools for trustworthy artificial intelligence and risk management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll see us announce joint approaches on technical discussions to the international standard-setting bodies, an early warning system to better predict and address potential semiconductor supply chain disruptions, a transatlantic approach to semiconductor investments aimed at ensuring security of supply through strengthened ecosystems and investments.&nbsp; As both Washington and Brussels look to encourage semiconductor investment in our respective countries, we do so in a coordinated fashion and don’t simply encourage a subsidy race.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll see us announce a dedicated task force to promote the use of trusted ICTS suppliers through financing for deployments in third countries, be announcing a new cooperation framework to explore issues to inform information integrity in crises, particularly on digital platforms with a focus on ongoing issues related to the misinformation, false information that Russia is spreading related to its war on Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll see us announce a stakeholder-focused trade and labor dialogue to promote internationally recognized labor rights.&nbsp; We’ll be developing joint and coordinated strategies to address the adverse impact on the U.S. and EU economies of non-market trade distortive policies and practices, be establishing a policy dialogue aimed at developing responses to global food security challenges caused by Russian aggression in Ukraine, be announcing an early alert mechanism to identify and address at an early stage non-market trade concerns which may disadvantage the transatlantic economy.</p>



<p>We’ll be announcing plans to have a U.S.-EU guide to cybersecurity best practices for small and medium-sized companies whose business is impacted disproportionately from cyber threats.&nbsp; And we’ll be launching a new climate and clean tech-focused dialogue on lifecycle greenhouse gas assessments, methodologies on green public procurement and on electric vehicles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I think you’ve really seen us do a lot over the last six months and I think you’re really seeing us going forward, driving forward work across a whole range of issues that we had hoped to be accomplishing through the TTC process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back to you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Let’s go to our next speaker.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone.&nbsp; Well, I won’t go into the deliverables.&nbsp; You’ve already heard about them in detail.&nbsp; But I would just say that the TTC is really a cornerstone of the U.S.-EU economic partnership, and promotes an affirmative agenda on key global technology, economic, and trade issues that is really based on our democratic values while working to reduce areas of friction in the U.S.-EU relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so our task is multi-fold, to put forward and carry out a compelling vision for global trade and technology in a way that serves our people, protects our interests, and promotes innovation and our democratic values, including respect for human rights.&nbsp; And as others have said, these efforts really reflect the deep and abiding partnership between the United States and the EU and its member states, as well as our shared values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Together, the U.S. and the EU account for a quarter of global trade and almost half of global GDP and that represents a huge driver of economic prosperity for citizens on both sides of the Atlantic.&nbsp; And so, the goal here is really to find ways to ensure that our competition policies, our technology regulations are complementary and that our markets are ever more interconnected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in addition to addressing technical issues like supply chain bottlenecks and other things that have been described already, the TTC has really proven to be an agile framework that facilitates our cooperation on global issues.&nbsp; As has already been said, I think, our cooperation on sanctions and export controls is really a great example and the relationship and the shared, common operating picture developed via the TTC have really helped us to take groundbreaking steps in those areas, in response to Putin’s war of aggression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I would also just as a final note say that those types of steps that we have taken together would not have been possible without the work that we have done in the TTC and pre-dating the TTC and leading up to the U.S.-EU summit last year to really remove obstacles to deeper cooperation, and to focus on our shared values in terms of articulating an affirmative vision for trade and technology that promotes democracy, human rights, and other shared values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, we really see that this deeper cooperation not only will help to deepen our trade and economic ties, but it also will help us to articulate a vision of the kind of world we want to see, and to help preserve the rules-based international order that we have created over the last 70 years.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great, thank you.&nbsp; Let’s go to [senior administration official].</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; You’ve heard a lot already, so I’ll be brief.&nbsp; And I thought I might just try to ground some of what you’ve already heard in the technical work that’s happening in the working groups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, first, you’ve heard from all of us the priority we put on revitalizing transatlantic ties and advancing a common agenda that’s based on market-oriented democratic values.&nbsp; That certainly is animating our work at the Department of Commerce, the work that my colleague referenced in transatlantic data privacy framework, the work in relation to resolving disputes over 232 tariffs, and now in the TTC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Export controls have already been mentioned, but I think it’s a prime example of where deep technical collaboration that was happening in TTC prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was able to be leveraged so we could move with remarkable speed to put in place these unprecedented collaboration on export controls.&nbsp; I guess the point that I would share, and again with a lot of ground already covered, is just that’s something that’s risen to geopolitical fore because of the crisis in Ukraine but similar types of technical work are being done on supply chains, on ITTS infrastructure, on standards, on AI that is really deepening our collaboration, helping us align the future of standards and policy in ways that I think will be exceptionally meaningful going forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So with a lot of ground covered, I’ll be brief and just stop there and look forward to questions.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And for our last speaker, let’s go to [senior administration official].</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you very much and good afternoon, everyone.&nbsp; Thanks for joining.&nbsp; The USTR is very excited to join the second ministerial meeting of the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council with our colleagues from the State and the Commerce Departments next week.</p>



<p>Since 2021, Ambassador Tai has made it a significant priority to rebuild and revitalize our bilateral and multilateral relationships with our partners around the world.&nbsp; This work was part of President Biden’s vision to make America a leader on the world stage and partner with our allies on pressing global issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think over the past year perhaps no relationship has seen more progress or success than our engagement with the European Union.&nbsp; In June 2021, Ambassador Tai resolved the 17-year-old large civil aircraft dispute involving Boeing and Airbus.&nbsp; In October, she announced, along with Secretary Raimondo, an arrangement to address global steel and aluminum non-market excess capacity, which will preserve the long-term viability of critical domestic sectors, help fulfill the President’s climate agenda and protect American jobs.&nbsp; We also terminated investigations of unilateral digital services taxes in Europe in favor of an OECD pluri-lateral negotiation.</p>



<p>The foundation of trust and respect we’ve built with our EU partners has enabled us to make tremendous progress in our collaboration through the TTC.&nbsp; So next week in France, you will hear Ambassador Tai talk about our joint commitment to tackling urgent economic trade and technology issues impacting people on both sides of the Atlantic.&nbsp; As you have heard, this cooperation is grounded on our shared values, specifically our respect for internationally recognized labor rights, for transparency, a level playing field, and the rule of law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To give a few examples, through the TTC, we will establish a transatlantic labor dialogue aimed at giving labor a seat at the table along with business as we develop trade initiatives to ensure that they address the needs of workers.&nbsp; And this includes making sure that businesses and workers make successful digital and green transitions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second example, we will work closely together as we each take our own actions to defend ourselves against non-market economy policies and practices in third countries that unfairly undermine our competitiveness in new and emerging technologies, and that threaten U.S. jobs.&nbsp; And we will also work to avoid the negative impacts of those actions on each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And final example, we will undertake to consult with each other at an early stage on our regulatory and other initiatives that could impact bilateral trade to avoid as much as possible the emergence of unnecessary barriers to trade in new and emerging technologies, which would undermine a strong transatlantic market for those technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And of course, we will continue the close collaboration you have seen over the past three months to isolate Russia from multilateral trading institutions and the global economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Ambassador Tai has said many times, strong and durable trade relationships require regular engagement and consultations to ensure that both sides are aligned on key priorities.&nbsp; The Trade and Technology Council was created to do exactly that.&nbsp; We’re looking forward to productive conversations in France next week, and in the months to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I will now turn things back over to our moderator to begin the question-and-answer session.&nbsp; Moderator.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Thanks, everyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, guys, for doing this call.&nbsp; I guess I wanted to ask kind of more broadly if you think the focus of this meeting will be Russia or if it’s shifting back to China.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And along the lines of the semiconductor supply chain issues you mentioned, if there was any stuff afoot shore up neon supplies, which is such a key ingredient for semiconductors, and a lot of it comes from Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And also if there’ll be any discussion of, I guess, tightening up export controls on advanced semiconductor equipment to Chinese chipmakers like SMIC.&nbsp; Thank you so much.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Hi, Alex.&nbsp; I’ll take the first part of that question and then open it up to others on the second.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, I think you’re going to see Russia as a focus across a number of areas of the TTC’s work.&nbsp; I mean, if we look at supply chains, we have been worried about China-related supply chains.&nbsp; We’re going to continue to be worried about China-related supply chains.&nbsp; But as your question suggests, we’re going to see us talk about the supply chain impacts from Russia and look for ways collectively to address them, probably particularly in global food issues, where we are quite concerned about a looming food security crisis in the back part of this year because of Putin’s war.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I think you’ll see us look at Russia in the supply chain space; Russia, obviously, in the Russian disinformation kind of space.&nbsp; Obviously, Russia has implications for trade, but I don’t think we’re losing our focus.&nbsp; I think you just heard USTR talk about the ongoing work and the continuing ongoing work that we need to be doing together about China.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I think this is very much a case of being able to walk and chew gum at the same time and address the impacts we’re seeing, the very serious impacts we’re seeing because of Russia’s war on Ukraine while also continuing the work we started last fall collectively on China.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; I can add a little bit on the on the last part of your question, which is, I think the TTC is certainly discussing all parts of the semiconductor supply chain through the working groups.&nbsp; And I think one of the reasons you’re hearing all of us talk about export controls, generally, is that I think there’s an agreement the foundation that we have built now with the Russia export controls is something that we can really build on.&nbsp; And it’s something as a basis for transatlantic cooperation more broadly.&nbsp; So I think you’ll see in the statement some reference to ways that we can consolidate that cooperation and that framework going forward.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thank you.&nbsp; Does anyone else have any thoughts before we move to the next question?</p>



<p>All right.&nbsp; Can we do our next question, please?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; Thanks so much for doing this call.&nbsp; I wonder if there’s specifically any plans to discuss China’s industrial subsidies with your counterparts in the European Union next week.&nbsp; I know that’s been a concern for many of the agencies on the call today, but Europeans have not been as apt to call out those industrial subsidies as unfair trade practices.&nbsp; Is that something that you plan to bring up next week?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; We do have a set of outcomes, which will be part of the discussion about our coordination together to push back against the injurious effects of these non-market economy policies and practices, including in key priority sectors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You mentioned subsidies but I think it’s fair to say that the non-market economy policies and practices go far beyond subsidies to include state-directed &#8212; government-directed state enterprises, force technology transfer, a broad range of industrial policies that really threatens some of the important emerging technologies that we are competitive in and should remain competitive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, I think the importance of us working together to counter the bundle of non-market economy policies and practices &#8212; which includes subsidies, but not only &#8212; will, to my mind, clearly be a focus of the discussions and of the outcomes next week.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; And if I can just add, I think, zooming out a bit, we really have seen incredible convergence in terms of just European understanding of the challenge that China poses from an economic perspective, but increasingly, as well, from a security perspective, given China’s support for Putin’s aggression in Ukraine, and the “no limits partnership” between Russia and the PRC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so this was a topic of conversation in the recent U.S.-EU high-level dialogue on China, which took place a few weeks ago in Brussels led by Deputy Secretary of State Sherman.&nbsp; And it’s an area of, I would say, continuing and increasing focus in our work with the EU, as we look to really ramp up cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thank you.&nbsp; Any other thoughts before we move to the next question?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: This is [senior administration official], just to say I totally agree.&nbsp; And I think it’s fair to say that several years ago you would never have seen the kind of convergence and outcomes that we’ll be seeing in this TTC coming up.&nbsp; There’s been a very significant convergence over the last few years.&nbsp; So this is very different from what one would have seen several years ago.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thank you.&nbsp; Can we do our next question, please?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thank you.&nbsp; I was just wondering, you went over this a bit but if you could detail some of the efforts with relation to non-market economies.&nbsp; You talked about a trade dialogue on non-market challenges.&nbsp; Is that right?&nbsp; And an early alert mechanism for non-market challenges that disadvantage the U.S. economy.&nbsp; Can you give some more detail there?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Well, this is [senior administration official] again.&nbsp; Maybe I can give a few details.&nbsp; We each have and the European Union increasingly has their own measures of laws, regulations, actions to take to push back against various non-market economy policies and practices.&nbsp; So one of the things we’re doing in the TTC is a plan to work closely together so that we can leverage the instruments on both sides so that we can push back on those non-market economy policies and practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also intend to identify particular practices and particular sectors that present challenges from a non-market economy point of view and develop joint strategies to push back on the injurious effects of the non-market economy policies and practices in those sectors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think, very importantly, we’re also looking very much to make sure to avoid as much as possible, as we each take our own actions, which ideally will be advanced in cooperation with each other, that we don’t inadvertently hit each other and that we use those tools together and leverage them to push back against the particular non-market economy policies and practices that are undermining our competitiveness in key areas.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I want to be mindful of the time and just get a couple of more questions in.&nbsp; So can we please do our next question?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks so much for doing this.&nbsp; Can you guys just maybe talk about the timeline on the chip supply disruption and early warning system?&nbsp; And what we’re seeing now with the lockdowns in China, has that changed the conversation for that timeline?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; This is an issue we’ve been working with the Europeans on over the last couple of months.&nbsp; As you know, we &#8212; last year, Commerce Department did a process to solicit information from U.S. semiconductor companies and companies consuming semiconductors on supply chain vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we had, actually, via our embassies last year, gotten a number of our embassies out in the Southeast Asia to set up for the U.S. side an early warning system where we were tracking key semiconductor-oriented production sites across Southeast Asia to understand as early as possible when disruptions would emerge.&nbsp; I think that early warning system that we established on a U.S. basis late last year, last fall &#8212; September, October &#8212; has been very helpful in helping us get ahead of a couple of potential shutdowns that would have hit earlier this year with Delta.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is really a chance for us to expand that work and multilateralize it with our European partners.&nbsp; I would say we are very closely monitoring the situation in China, which is clearly impacting a number of different supply chains, not just semiconductors.&nbsp; We’ve seen a number of different products being hit from that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t know if you have anything you want to add to that.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; No, I would just say it’s been all along one of the highest priority initiatives for the Commerce Department, within TTC and outside of it, and something that comes up in bilateral engagements with any of the semiconductor producing countries.&nbsp; And so there’s different variations of this conversation with a lot of countries.&nbsp; It was very much high priority before any more recent concerns about shutdowns in China and so a great deal of urgency already.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re excited about what we’re going to announce on Monday in this regard.&nbsp; I think there’s a lot more work we can build on with our European counterparts on this.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: &nbsp;Great.&nbsp; Let’s do our last question, please.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much for doing this.&nbsp; I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the principals who will be attending and how they’ll break up their roles.&nbsp; I see that Secretary of State Blinken is going; U.S. Trade Representative is going.&nbsp; Secretary Raimondo is going.&nbsp; How will they kind of break up their roles and responsibilities?&nbsp; And who from the White House specifically or the top-ranked White House official, who will that be?&nbsp; Who will be attending from the White House?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; So, thanks.&nbsp; This is [senior administration official].&nbsp; As you note, our principals are Ambassador Tai, Secretary Blinken, and Secretary Raimondo.&nbsp; They are co-leading this as they did in the fall.</p>



<p>I’m not going to get into exactly who’s going to say what at each of the different sessions, but the flow of the day &#8212; there’s a dinner Sunday evening, a working dinner Sunday evening for the principals.&nbsp; And then there are a set of sessions on Monday focused on different topics, including a session with stakeholders from both Europe and in the U.S.&nbsp; I think you’ll see very active participation by each of our principals across the different sessions, focusing, obviously, on the issues within each of their remits.&nbsp; Obviously, it’s also three principals who work very well together across a whole range of issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a>The White House does not attend this at a principal level, but there are a couple of White House staff who will be attending.</a></p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Any other thoughts before we wrap up the call on this question?</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Sure, I would just add that I think this has been actually a really good exercise in terms of knitting together all of these equities and those of other departments and agencies that also participate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, within the State Department, we have half a dozen bureaus that are very active within the TTC’s 10 working groups.&nbsp; And beyond the three co-chairs, as I said, there are a number of different agencies that are also involved at the working group level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, I think it really just demonstrates the breadth of the U.S.-EU partnership and how cross-cutting these issues are that we’re dealing with, and that the TTC is really designed not just to deal with the trade and economic aspects, and the regulatory aspects of the digital side of things, but also to really bring in our shared values and the democratic and human rights aspects of the challenges that we face related to both trade and technology.&nbsp; So it really is pretty close to a whole-of-government effort.</p>



<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Well, thanks, everyone, for joining.&nbsp; As a reminder, this call was on background, attributable to &#8220;senior administration officials,&#8221; and the contents of this call are embargoed until Sunday 11:00 p.m. Eastern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have any more questions, please feel (inaudible) to myself or the State Department, Commerce, and USTR.&nbsp; Thanks, everyone.&nbsp; Have a good day.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Joint Base Andrews<br><em>Prince George’s County, Maryland</em></em></p>



<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; So, we are &#8212; I&#8217;m leading a delegation on behalf of the President and our administration to express our condolences.&nbsp;<br><br>The United States takes quite seriously the strength of our relationship and partnership with UAE.&nbsp; And we are going there, then, to express our condolences, but also as an expression of our commitment to the strength of that relationship and continuing to strengthen that relationship.<br><br>I&#8217;ll speak also about what happened in Buffalo.&nbsp; It&#8217;s horrendous.&nbsp; It&#8217;s horrendous.&nbsp; In our country, we have to recognize that we may very well be experiencing an epidemic of hate towards so many Americans that is wrong.&nbsp; It is taking on a level of violence &#8212; in the case of what happened in Buffalo, and we&#8217;ve seen it in other places in our country.&nbsp; And we all must speak out against it.<br><br>Hate against any one of us, we should interpret as being hate against all of us, as a nation.&nbsp; We are a nation that prides ourselves on our diversity as an element of our strength.&nbsp; And to see what has happened yesterday &#8212;<br><br>An 86-year-old grandmother who had just been taking care of her husband in a nursing home, was just going to get some groceries.<br><br>A security guard who dedicated his life as a law enforcement officer and was known in the community to be one of the kindest, most gentle people, who showed extraordinary heroism.<br><br>I think we all have to know that this is something that we have to not only speak about, but we&#8217;ve got to do everything in our power as a nation to stop it &#8212; to stop it.&nbsp; There&#8217;s too much at stake that we should be working at and thinking about, not hating one another.<br><br>END&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">U.S. Capitol<br>Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>12:28 P.M. EDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:  President Yoes; Auxiliary President Hennie; Auxiliary President Lehmann; and Director and good friend Jimmy Pasco &#8212; we&#8217;ve worked together a long time: Thank you for inviting me to join you today and for the service you&#8217;ve extended to this nation. <br><br>I’d also like to thank the Attorney General &#8212; General Garland; Attorney General Gupta; Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas; and the Directors of the FBI and Secret Service;  Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; the U.S.  Marshalls Service; U.S. Capitol Police &#8212; all for being here, but for your leadership. <br><br>We’re also joined by my long-time friends, Senator Patrick Leahy and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. <br><br>Before I begin, let me say a word about yesterday’s mass shooting in Buffalo, New York.  A lone gunman, armed with weapons of war and a hate-filled soul, shot and killed 10 innocent people in cold blood at a grocery story on Saturday afternoon. <br><br>Jill and I, like all of you, pray for the victims and their families and a devastated community.<br><br>I’ve been receiving updates from my team at the White House that’s in close contact with the Justice Department.  We&#8217;re still gathering the facts, but already the Justice Department has stated publicly that it is investigating the matter as a hate crime, a racially motivated act of white supremacy and violent extremism.  <br><br>As they do, we must all work together to address the hate that remains a stain on the soul of America.  Our hearts are heavy once again, but our resolve must never, ever waver.  <br><br>No one understands this more than the people sitting in front of me &#8212; moms, dads, children, family members &#8212; about how those folks in Buffalo feel today when they got the call.  They&#8217;re pulled into &#8212; it&#8217;s as if you get pulled into a black hole in your chest and there&#8217;s no way out.<br><br>Jill and I know &#8212; we know no memorial, no gestures can fill the void in the hearts they have now or that you &#8212; you who have lost someone feel as well.<br><br>Being here today and hearing the name of your husband, wife, father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister brings it all back as if you just got that phone call 10 minutes ago.<br><br>The American people, we owe you.  You know, you (inaudible) down the street, you&#8217;re normal families, all neighbors.  And every day, you worry and you worry you&#8217;d get that phone call when they pinned on that shield.  And now you look at an empty chair.<br><br>Although I didn’t personally know your husbands, wives, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, I knew them.  They were the first ones to run into help when everyone else ran away when we were kids, when we were young men and women.  Even in grade school, they&#8217;d jump in when someone else was threatened or being bullied, regardless of the odds.<br><br>Think about it.  It was part of their DNA.  They didn&#8217;t think about it in terms of serving and protecting and defending, but that&#8217;s what they did.  They served even before they put on that shield.  They protected.  And they were there.<br><br>Being a police officer is not just what they did.  It’s who they were.<br><br>I was telling the president of this organization, I grew up in a neighborhood where you became a cop, a firefighter, or a priest.  I wasn&#8217;t qualified for any of them, so here I am.  (Laughter.)  <br><br>But all kidding aside, we expect so much from our law enforcement officers today.  This is a different world we&#8217;re in.  Just in the last several years, it&#8217;s so much more complicated.  The job is complicated.   <br><br>Yet we expect so much more of all of you.  We expect you to be drug counselors for the 100,000 overdose deaths that took place this year &#8212; 100,000.  <br><br>We expect you to counsel those who speak to a couple in the midst of a violent confrontation of a husband and wife, man and woman.  So many of you are &#8212; literally and figuratively get caught in the crossfire.  You&#8217;re not trained psychologists; you&#8217;re law enforcement officers.<br><br>We expect you to be everything.  We expect everything of you.  Being a cop today is a heck of a lot harder than it’s ever been.  COVID-19 &#8212; one million deaths in America, leaving behind, the estimates indicate, nine significant family members or others who also look at that empty chair at the kitchen table.  So many kids left behind because of COVID and schools closing down.<br><br>You engage in longer shifts.  The strain and stress of it all is why I continue to be so committed to do more, do better to keep you safe, to keep our communities safe, and to build trust and respect that everyone deserves, particularly all of you.<br><br>We should focus on and fund the things we know that work, like crime prevention and community policing.  Not one cop in a car, but two walking the street.  Cops who walk the beat, who know the neighborhood, who can restore trust and safety. <br><br>Folks, the answer is not to abandon the streets.  It’s not to choose between safety and equal justice.  And we should agree: It’s not to defund the police.  It’s to fund the police.  Fund them with the resources, the training &#8212; (applause) &#8212; they need to protect our communities and themselves and restore trust among the police and the people. <br><br>My dad used to say &#8212; when someone would say, &#8220;Let me tell you what I value, Joe.&#8221;  He&#8217;d look at them and say, &#8220;Don’t tell me what you…&#8221;  My dad was a well-read, high-school-educated man who was a graceful man.  He&#8217;d say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me what you value.  Show me your budget, and I will tell you what you value.&#8221;<br><br>Well, here’s what I value.  As soon as I came to office, we inherited a raging pandemic, with only 2 million people vaccinated.  We needed to rebuild our economy and restore public safety.  <br><br>We understood the risk that communities could face with rising violence during the pandemic and at a time when state and local budgets were shrinking because they didn&#8217;t have the tax base.  They were having to lay off cops, firefighters, teachers.  They were under tremendous strain.<br><br>So, we made sure we passed a thing called the American Rescue Plan, providing historic $350 billion directly to the cities and counties and states and Tribes so they didn&#8217;t have to lay off law enforcement.  They could keep the cops on the job and fight to keep communities safe. <br><br>And it’s working.  More than 300 communities, from big cities to small towns, are using more than $10 billion of American Rescue Plan funds for violence prevention and public safety this year &#8212; building new police training facilities; recruiting, which is getting harder; hiring; and giving policemen a raise; partnering with the federal, state, and local community groups to reduce gun violence; investing in community interventions that use trusted community members to work directly with people who are most likely to commit gun crimes or become the victims of gun crimes and intervene before it’s too late. <br><br>My mother used to say, &#8220;Out of everything bad, something good will come if you look hard enough for it.&#8221;  Well, we&#8217;re looking hard to determine why and what we can do to prevent that law enforcement officer being put in the middle.<br><br>I’m encouraging every mayor, governor to use the American resource money they have, and they have it now.  You spend it now &#8212; this summer, when crime historically spikes.<br><br>And this Rescue funding for police is part of a comprehensive strategy to combat violence in America.  I&#8217;ve laid out this plan to all the police agencies, and they&#8217;re taking a good look at it.<br><br>With my budget last year, we increased funding for state and local law enforcement by almost &#8212; well, not almost &#8212; 29 percent.  That included significant investment in Community Oriented Policing Services &#8212; the “COPS” program designed to build legitimacy and trust in communities, to address violent crime, to combat hate and extremism. </p>



<p>My budget for next year doubles the investment in community policing &#8212; $<s>573</s>&nbsp;[537] million, the most in over a decade.&nbsp;&nbsp;And on top of that, it includes $30 billion in new mandatory investments in law enforcement and crime prevention.&nbsp;<br><br>During my State of the Union Address, I announced what I called a Unity Agenda that brings the country together to address the big challenges we face.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And one of those included ending the opioid edemic [sic] &#8212; epidemic and addressing the mental health crisis.&nbsp; So many, young and old, because of this pandemic, need help.&nbsp; And having a problem &#8212; a mental problem &#8212; is no different that breaking your arm or your leg.&nbsp; You need invest in systems that provide adequate healthcare, counseling drug treatment, prevention, housing, education, and other social services to those that need it most.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Right now, in most places, you serve your time in prison, you get a bus ticket and 25 bucks, and you end up under the same bridge you got arrested under the first time.&nbsp; They should have access to education and housing.&nbsp; Give them a chance to move beyond where they were.<br><br>And I’m committed to investing in mental health services so we have more school counselors, psychologists, and social workers working alongside you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>At the same time, we have to do more to protect our officers’ mental health and emotional well-being.&nbsp; Suicide was the second-highest cause of death for law enforcement officers in 2021, surpassed only by COVID-19.&nbsp;<br><br>Last November, I signed laws that extended critical peer counseling and mental health resources for officers, expanded elibilit- &#8212; eligibility for benefits for first responders who were disabled in the line of duty.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not unusual.&nbsp;<br><br>We wonder &#8212; we were talking briefly about the impact on the &#8212; post-traumatic stress.&nbsp; How many police officers have, multiple times, been put in line and had to do things that they didn&#8217;t have to &#8212; think they&#8217;d have to do?<br><br>We recognize it with our military.&nbsp; More people continue to die from post-traumatic stress at home than die in any wars that are going on now &#8212; 20 a week.&nbsp; It matters.&nbsp; We face up to it and help these folks &#8212; everyone.<br><br>There are other areas we need to continue to work on together.&nbsp; Forty percent of all the calls that result in an officer’s death are calls to intervene in a domestic violence dispute.&nbsp; Let me say it again: Forty percent.<br><br>You expect officers to have degrees in psychology?&nbsp; Do we expect them to have things that are beyond the capacity of any PhD or doc or anybody else?<br><br>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to get reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, providing critical resources for law enforcement.<br><br>And I want to acknowledge law enforcement’s constructive role in trying to reach an agreement on meaningful policing legislation in Congress.&nbsp; We haven’t gotten there yet, but we must get there to strengthen public trust and public safety.&nbsp;<br><br>2021 was one of the strongest years on record when it comes to federal support delivered to state and local law enforcement.&nbsp; But while these are important steps, there&#8217;s much more work to be done.&nbsp; I’m committed to being your partner, as I always have.&nbsp;<br><br>Let me close with this.&nbsp; Jill and I know how it is when there&#8217;s a memorial service for our son, who won the Bronze Star and Conspicuous Service Medal in Iraq.&nbsp; We were proud, but we also &#8212; it&#8217;s bittersweet, because you remember everything.<br><br>I want to thank the families that are here.&nbsp; It really takes courage to show up, because everything comes back.&nbsp; Everything comes back.<br><br>A short walk from here at the National Law Enforcement Memorial, there is a quote engraved on the wall.&nbsp; And the quote goes, &#8220;It is not how these officers died that made them heroes, it is how they lived.&#8221;<br><br>To the families, Jill and I &#8212; we have some idea how hard it is.&nbsp; But I promise you: The day will come when the memory of your loved one &#8212; you open that closet door and you smell the scent, or you go by that park you used to walk in, or you hear that song.&nbsp; The day will come when it will bring a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eyes.&nbsp; And through your pain and your will to find a purpose worthy of how they lived, you&#8217;ll get through it.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s nothing easy about it.<br><br>Our hope and prayer is that we as a nation find that purpose as well.&nbsp; May the souls of those who you loved and those with whom you served rest in peace and rise in glory.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>May God bless you all.&nbsp; And may God protect our police and our troops.&nbsp; God bless you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br><br>12:46 P.M. EDT</p>

<p>Today our hearts are broken and we grieve for the victims of the horrific act of gun violence in Buffalo and for their families and friends.  The Second Gentleman and I are praying for all those who knew and lost love ones. <br> <br>Law enforcement is proceeding with its investigation, but what is clear is that we are seeing an epidemic of hate across our country that has been evidenced by acts of violence and intolerance.  We must call it out and condemn it. Racially-motivated hate crimes or acts of violent extremism are harms against all of us, and we must do everything we can to ensure that our communities are safe from such acts. </p>

<p>Tonight, we grieve for the families of ten people whose lives were senselessly taken and everyone who is suffering the physical and emotional wounds of this horrific shooting. We are grateful for the bravery of members of law enforcement and other first responders who took immediate action to try to protect and save lives. The First Lady and I are praying for the victims and their families, and hearts all across this country are with the people of Buffalo.</p>



<p>We still need to learn more about the motivation for today’s shooting as law enforcement does its work, but we don’t need anything else to state a clear moral truth: A racially motivated hate crime is abhorrent to the very fabric of this nation. Any act of domestic terrorism, including an act perpetrated in the name of a repugnant white nationalist ideology, is antithetical to everything we stand for in America. Hate must have no safe harbor. We must do everything in our power to end hate-fueled domestic terrorism.</p>

<p>I congratulate my long-time friend Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on his election as President of the United Arab Emirates.  As I told Sheikh Mohammed yesterday during our phone call, the United States is determined to honor the memory of the late president Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan by continuing to strengthen the strategic partnership between our countries over the coming months and years. The UAE is an essential partner of the United States.  Sheikh Mohammed, whom I met with several times as Vice President when he was the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, has long been at the forefront of building this partnership. I look forward to working with Sheikh Mohammed to build from this extraordinary foundation to further strengthen the bonds between our countries and peoples. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">State Department<br>Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>4:16 P.M. EDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; My whole name.&nbsp; Thank you all very much.&nbsp; Good afternoon, everyone.&nbsp; I said last night &#8212; let me reiterate: It&#8217;s been wonderful, wonderful to host you all in the first-ever U.S-ASEAN Summit in Washington, D.C.&nbsp;<br><br>And besides, Mr. President, the food wasn&#8217;t bad.&nbsp; It was pretty good.&nbsp; We haven&#8217;t had &#8212; been ha- &#8212; been able to have, essentially, state dinners in a long time because of COVID.&nbsp; But thank you all for being there.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re not only celebrating 45 years of partnership and friendship between ASEAN and the United States, we&#8217;re launching a new era &#8212; a new era in U.S.-ASEAN relations.&nbsp;<br><br>Let me thank Prime Minister Hun Sen and &#8212; for the 22 &#8212; as the 2022 ASEAN Chair.&nbsp;<br><br>And President Widodo, I want to thank you as well &#8212; the Country Coordinator for ASEAN and U.S. Dialogue Relations &#8212; and &#8212; and for all the hard work to make this summit, I believe &#8212; I hope you believe &#8212; a success.<br><br>Over the past two days, we&#8217;ve spent time with members of &#8211;you &#8212; you&#8217;ve spent time with members of Congress, the American business community.&nbsp; You just finished a good session with the Vice President.&nbsp; And you&#8217;ve met with a number of our Cabinet members.&nbsp; And I wanted you to be as exposed as you could and understand there&#8217;s enthusiasm &#8212; that it&#8217;s not just at the President&#8217;s level and the Vice President’s level, but throughout the entire administration &#8212; for this relationship and &#8212; and bettering it.<br><br>You know, discussions have covered a broad range of critical issues, including working together to keep the fight against COVID under control and to take climate action.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And by the way, I see Secretary Kerry down there.&nbsp; And, John, thanks for letting me into your old house.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Appreciate it.&nbsp;&nbsp;John has forgotten about &#8212; more about, in my view, the needs we have for climate security than anyone that I know.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks, John, for being here.&nbsp; I want to talk about that a little bit as we go into this here &#8212; in this &#8212; the rest of the day.<br><br>Discussions have covered a broad range of critical issues, including working together to keep up the fight against COVID-19; to take climate action and pursue a clean energy future; build a sustainable, high-standard infrastructure; and to expand access to education; enhance maritime cooperation.&nbsp;<br><br>And &#8212; and the breadth of our discussions reflect just how vital the Indo-Pacific and ASEAN region are to the United States of America, from our perspective.<br><br>And a great deal of history &#8212; the great deal of history of our world in the next 50 years is going to be written and the ASEAN countries and our relationship with you is the future in the coming years and decades.&nbsp;<br><br>The ASEAN centrality is the very heart of my administration’s strategy in pursuing the future we all want to see.&nbsp; And I mean that sincerely.&nbsp;<br><br>The &#8212; the Indo-Pacific is an Indo-Pacific that is free and open, stable and prosperous, and resilient and secure.&nbsp; It’s what we&#8217;re all seeking.&nbsp;&nbsp;And that&#8217;s why I asked [Vice] President Harris to travel to the region last August.&nbsp;&nbsp;And that&#8217;s why, last October, at our virtual summit, I announced $100 million to support &#8212; for programs to strengthen U.S.-ASEAN cooperation.&nbsp;<br><br>And today, I&#8217;m announcing another $150 million of initiatives to deepen U.S.-ASEAN relations and achieve more &#8212; our &#8212; even better our shared objectives from the Coast Guard to climate change to &#8212; to modern infrastructure.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a whole range of things that we have to work on.&nbsp;<br><br>And I&#8217;m also proud to announce that I have nominated one of my closest advisors to be U.S. Ambassador to ASEAN: Yohannes Abraham.&nbsp; I know you&#8217;ve already all seen him.&nbsp; But, Yohannes, you got to come back once in a while and say hi to us.<br><br>Yohannes served as the Chief of Staff of the National Security Council since the first day of my administration.&nbsp; And so, this is a fellow who I&#8217;m a little concerned to send in because he knows how I think.&nbsp; You know, I mean, he knows so much about me, I&#8217;m a little worried.&nbsp;<br><br>But all kidding aside, he is &#8212; I think you&#8217;re going to find him completely knowledgeable and he speaks for &#8212; will speak for me and speak for my administration.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Yohannes is &#8212; I wish him luck.&nbsp; He&#8217;s a &#8212; he&#8217;s the key reason why I think we &#8212; this summit has been the success it has.&nbsp; I presume to believe you believe as I do: It has been a success thus far.&nbsp; And he&#8217;ll be a trusted representative and &#8212; to continue deepening this critical partnership among all of us.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re committed to a future where the rules and norms that have made possible so much growth and prosperity and stability in the Indo-Pacific are upheld and strengthened, including respect for the rule of law and for human rights.<br><br>This is something that benefits all one billion of the people who live in our countries, from the United States and all of you.&nbsp; And as we look around the world &#8212; all the challenges we&#8217;re facing &#8212; the ASEAN-U.S. partnership is critical, I think, to meeting the moment we find ourselves in history right now.<br><br>And so, let me thank you again for making the journey to Washington to celebrate the enduring friendship we share and to look ahead at all that I believe &#8212; we all believe &#8212; we can accomplish together and how much more we can do.<br><br>We’ll continue to elevate this partnership and strengthen our cooperation and to make a better, safer, and more prosperous world for all our children.&nbsp;<br><br>So, thank you, thank you.&nbsp; Thank you very much.<br><br>4:22 P.M. EDT</p>
