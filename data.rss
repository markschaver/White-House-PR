<p>The deal reached by President Biden and the bipartisan group of Senators makes a once-in-a-generation investment in our infrastructure and will create good-paying union jobs repairing our roads and bridges, replacing lead pipes, and building energy transmission lines. It invests in clean energy manufacturing and zero-emission vehicles ensuring that the jobs in the clean energy industry are good-paying, quality American jobs. The deal ensures that all taxpayer-funded infrastructure projects use materials made in America.</p>



<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will create good jobs for workers across the country, including workers in rural areas, hard-hit energy workers, historically disadvantaged workers, and workers in distressed areas. This historic investment will accelerate the economic recovery, put Americans back to work, and boost wages for workers across the country.</p>



<p>The legislation will:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Create millions of good-paying jobs.</strong>&nbsp;With the President’s Build Back Better agenda, the investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will add, on average, around 2 million jobs per year over the course of the decade, accelerating America’s path to full employment while bringing workers who have been left behind into the labor force.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Protect critical labor standards on construction projects.&nbsp;</strong>The overwhelming majority of the funds in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will be subject to Davis-Bacon requirements, which ensure that contractors pay workers on construction projects a fair, prevailing wage so that local wages, labor markets, and workers won’t be undercut. These requirements will protect wages for millions of workers, grow the economy, and support good-paying, union jobs.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Grow wages in the clean energy industry.</strong>&nbsp;President Biden committed to ensuring that the new jobs created in the clean energy industry—solar, wind, carbon capture, energy transmission—would be good-paying, union jobs. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act extends prevailing wage protections to all energy infrastructure provisions, including the construction of EV charging stations on highways and in communities, ensuring that these critical jobs come with good wages and benefits and support local unions.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Put pipefitters to work making communities safer.</strong>&nbsp;The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will put pipefitters to work across the country with an historic investment in our water infrastructure, including funding to replace all of the nation’s lead water pipes. It also invests $1 billion to modernize and repair natural gas distribution pipelines, creating good-paying jobs while fighting the climate crisis by reducing methane emissions, as well as making our communities safer.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Buy America.&nbsp;</strong>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act lives up to the President’s commitment to ensure that the future is made in America by American workers. The legislation includes a comprehensive Buy America provision to ensure that all taxpayer-funded infrastructure and public works projects are built with American iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials. This will create good-paying manufacturing jobs here at home and further the President’s commitment to revitalizing the domestic industrial base.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Protect and support transit workers</strong>. The agreement provides unprecedented support for transportation&nbsp;workers who have worked tirelessly on the frontlines of the pandemic. The legislation includes new provisions to prevent operator assaults built on collective bargaining and labor-management collaboration, so that no transit worker should fear for their safety just for doing their job. And it provides over $300 million in grant funding to train transit workers on the zero-emission vehicles of the future, including through registered apprenticeships and other joint labor-management training programs.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Support auto workers</strong>. Auto workers and good, union auto manufacturing jobs are the backbone of communities across the country. As the country transitions to zero-emission vehicles, the President committed to building those vehicles and their components here in the United States. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act invests in grants to support battery and battery component manufacturing, manufacturing facilities, and retooling and retrofitting of existing facilities. It also invests in good-paying jobs building a nationwide network of electric vehicle charging infrastructure along highway corridors, which will accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Invest in coal and energy communities</strong>. America’s coal miners and energy workers have powered this country for more than a century. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act invests in places impacted by shifting energy markets, including directing billions of dollars for advanced energy manufacturing facilities and clean energy demonstration projects to communities where coal mines or power plants have been shut down. The legislation also invests $21 billion in environmental remediation, creating good-paying union jobs in hard-hit energy communities cleaning up superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned gas wells.</li></ul>



<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is just one part of President Biden’s plan to create and support good-paying, union jobs and deliver workers the dignity and rights they are owed. The President’s Build Back Better plan will pair job creation efforts with workforce development programs, invest in child care and long-term care and the care workers that enable others to go to work, provide national paid family and medical leave, ensure federal agencies have the necessary resources to protect workers, and invest in other efforts to create good, union jobs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">State Dining Room</p>



<p>1:42 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Well, everybody, welcome. Today, I have the privilege of meeting with Latino leaders to discuss a bunch of key issues that affect the community; the progress we’re making against the pandemic; historic and economic recovery we’re under- &#8212; that’s undergoing &#8212; we’re undergoing; and immigration and voting rights, which are critical.</p>



<p>Latino leaders have been essential to helping us get the country vaccinated, with 70 percent of all adult Americans receiving at least one shot.</p>



<p>The vaccines work. Even as cases go up due to the highly transmissionable [sic] &#8212; transmissible disease, the Delta variant, we’re not seeing a comparable rise in hospitalizations or deaths in most of the country because of the vaccinations. This is an epidemic of the unvaccinated &#8212; a pandemic of the unvaccinated.</p>



<p>But we need everyone to get vaccinated in this pandemic. And it’s critical to keeping the economy strong.</p>



<p>And in six months, we’re seeing the fastest job growth of any point in any administration in history from the beginning of their administration, and the fastest economic growth in nearly 40 years.</p>



<p>And we have an opportunity to make historic investments in infrastructure and in American families, and finally build an economy that deals everybody in.</p>



<p>I’ve been saying from the beginning when I announced that I’m tired of trickle down. It doesn’t work very well. But when you build from the bottom up and the middle out, everybody does well, including the wealthy. That’s what this is all about.</p>



<p>And so, creating millions of good-paying jobs in every community and &#8212; including Latino neighborhoods &#8212; delivering affordable child and &#8212; care and paid leave and universal pre-K, two years of community college.</p>



<p>You know, today marks, as we all know &#8212; no one knows this better than this community – a two-year &#8212; two years of &#8212; since the shooting in El Paso. And all of us have, in our personal lives, lost people unexpectedly. Most of us have. We know how devastating it is, particularly one that was born out of such hatred.</p>



<p>But you know, I did a piece &#8212; Jill and I did a piece for the El Paso Times, but I realized after it was published that I didn’t talk about an aspect that is really important: There were 236 people who were wounded. How are they doing? The trauma. The equivalent of post-traumatic stress that comes from these kinds of things. I &#8212; and the need for &#8212; and I hope we’ll &#8212; we can talk about it a little bit later as well &#8212; is the need for mental health services and a whole range of things that affect not only them but their families when they’ve survived.</p>



<p>But to the families who have lost loved ones, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, Jill and send our love &#8212; as all of you do, I know.</p>



<p>But I know, you know, these anniversaries are &#8212; should be celebrated in a sense of recognize &#8212; so we see things don’t happen again. But, you know, they’re terrible for the victims and the survivors because it brings back everything like it happened the very moment ago. And I &#8212; it takes enormous courage for people to &#8212; to respond that way.</p>



<p>You know, and I know how hard these anniversaries are. As I said, no matter how much time has passed, it brings it all back like it happened that second.</p>



<p>The El Paso community &#8212; you know, they continue to show their courage and the resilience. But to all Americans, this tragedy reminds us of the unfinished work to heal &#8212; and I know I got criticized for running on it, but I really mean it &#8212; heal the soul of this country. We have to return to some decency and honor, and I just &#8212; anyway.</p>



<p>The gunman targeted people and the diversity of El Paso and our most deeply held American values. And, you know, we all act together to counter what is basically domestic terrorism, domestic violence, domestic extremism, and end the scourge of gun violence in America. We can’t end it, but we sure can make a big difference than what it is now. And so, I continue to do everything in my power to do that.</p>



<p>The most lethal terrorist threat to our homeland in recent years is domestic terrorism &#8212; domestic terrorism rooted in white supremacy. We’re going to have to stand united against this violence because it just spills over to all communities.</p>



<p>And my administration is carrying out the country’s first-ever comprehensive effort to tackle the threat of domestic terrorism &#8212; from reducing online radicalization to disrupting networks that inspire violence, and providing resources to communities to build up some resilience.</p>



<p>And I’m going to continue to fight this for more commonsense gun laws. And we’re going to continue to call on Congress to take action, which they’ve been reluctant to do.</p>



<p>That includes a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines like the one used in El Paso. The idea anybody needs, for a pistol and/or a rifle &#8212; anyone needs 10, 12, 20, 30, 100 rounds in a rifle is just &#8212; it just makes no sense at all. Zero. Doesn’t violate anybody’s Second Amendment rights to say, “You can’t do that.” But it just has to stop.</p>



<p>And that includes using my existing authority, which I have, to &#8212; from reining in “ghost guns” and &#8212; to investing in community policing and community violence intervention, to having &#8212; bringing in psychologists and social workers into the police forces to help.</p>



<p>And, you know, I look forward to hearing from this group about all of these issues and a lot more. And &#8212; but, with that, we’re going to discuss a wide range of issues, all of us here tonight &#8212; today. And I’m looking forward to it.</p>



<p>So, thank you all. Thank you, press, for being here.</p>



<p>Q Mr. President, should Andrew Cuomo resign, sir? Should Andrew Cuomo resign?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>



<p>Q Should Andrew Cuomo resign, sir?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT: Wait &#8212; wait a second. Be quiet, please.</p>



<p>I’m going to be speaking on COVID at four o’clock this afternoon, and I’ll take questions on COVID and other issues after that.</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>



<p>Q Thank you, sir.</p>



<p>1:49 P.M. EDT</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>2:17 P.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.&nbsp; I have a couple of items for all of you at the top.&nbsp; I wanted to take a moment to recognize the passing of Metropolitan Police Officer Gunther Hashida and Officer Kyle DeFreytag &#8212; two officers who bravely defended the Capitol, both during and after the insurrection on January 6th.&nbsp; Their deaths are a sad reminder of that shameful day in our country&#8217;s history and of the physical and mental scars left the officers who risked their lives to protect our Capitol and our democracy.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We heard firsthand, last week, from tho- &#8212; from some of those who served on that day, and their testimony reaffirmed the incredible bravery they showed in the worst possible circumstances.&nbsp; Their passing also reminds us of the remarkable courage of the men and women in law enforcement who serve with honor and leave home each day not knowing what risk they may face but are determined to protect their communities.&nbsp; We&#8217;re indebted to their services, and our thoughts go out to the friends, family, and loved ones of the two officers.<br>&nbsp;<br>And we want to remind those who are struggling that help is available 24/7.&nbsp; Please reach out to the Suicide Prevention line &#8212; Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I also wanted to mark that today is two years since the mass shooting in El Paso that killed 23 people in a terrible act of domestic terrorism.&nbsp; They targeted a city defined by its diversity and rich Hispanic heritage.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>This morning, the President published an op-ed in the El Paso Times sharing his and the First Lady&#8217;s condolences with the families who lost loved ones and the broader El Paso Community.&nbsp; And he wrote about how today is a somber reminder of the unfinished work to heal the soul of this nation and end the epidemic of gun violence that is taking lives and shattering communities.<br>&nbsp;<br>The President and Vice President are currently meeting, as you all know, with 12 Latino leaders in the State Dining Room.&nbsp; At the to- &#8212; and you heard the President speak at the top of the meeting, of course.&nbsp; During the meeting, the President will speak about the work we must do to counter domestic terrorism and the spread of hate-fueled violence in every form, and end the scourge of gun violence in America.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>They will also focus &#8212; they’ll also talk about the President&#8217;s Build Back Better agenda and how it will benefit Latinos throughout the country, our economic recovery, voting rights, and immigration.<br>&nbsp;<br>Also wanted to note that today we are marking Black Women’s Equal Pay Day, which marks how far into the year Black women working full time need to work to earn what their white non-Hispanic male counterparts earned in the previous year.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It takes a Black woman nearly 20 months to earn what a white man made in one year for the same work.&nbsp; Black women manage a disproportionate share of caregiving responsibilities, which have dramatically increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning that they may have to work part-time or leave the work &#8212; labor force entirely.&nbsp; They also comprise a disproportionate share of low-wage workers in industries, such as caregiving, that lack adequate compensation and benefits.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Biden-Harris administration has taken several steps to increase opportunity for Black women and girls, their families, and their communities to thrive in the workplace and to be economically secure &#8212; from the American Rescue Plan to the executive order to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the workforce and vetting racial equ- &#8212; equity across this administration&#8217;s response; to COVID-19 and the economic crisis; and prioritizing Black mental health.&nbsp; And we, of course, will continue our work.<br>&nbsp;<br>I think I&#8217;m almost done here.&nbsp; Finally, last thing here: As a part of our effort as the bipartisan infrastructure bill is working its way through the Senate, the President is quite focused on lifting up the benefits of the bill to the American people.&nbsp; So we&#8217;re going to highlight a different component each day, and we&#8217;ll also do that through our digital social channels as well.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So today I&#8217;m going to highlight the unprecedented investment of $80 billion in passenger and freight rail over five years.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a 500 percent increase over current services, and it represents the largest investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak a half a century ago.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>This money will help us eliminate Amtrak’s maintenance backlog; bring world-class rail service to areas around the country, creating good-paying union jobs in the process; and it will help make American businesses compete, grow, and expand by making it easier and cheaper for them to get their products to customers.<br>&nbsp;<br>With that, Jonathan, kick us off.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; In March, President Biden said that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo should resign if the New York Attorney General&#8217;s investigation confirmed allegations of sexual harassment.&nbsp; Today, the investigation found that Cuomo engaged in unwanted groping and kissing of at least 11 women, including current and former state employees.&nbsp; Does the President believe Governor Cuomo should resign?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the President just said that he&#8217;s going to speak to this later this afternoon and share his views, so I&#8217;m not going to get ahead of his &#8212; ahead of his comments he’ll make later.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have there been any conversations today between the governor&#8217;s office and anyone here at the White House?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No, there have not.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And why even &#8212; why &#8212; why the delay?&nbsp; Why not have the &#8212; did the President watch the governor&#8217;s video earlier?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, the President will give his own reaction to, of course, the announcement this morning and give his own view later this afternoon.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay. &nbsp;Then we’ll move on to something else then.&nbsp; There was a shooting today, earlier, at &#8212; that caused the lockdown of the Pentagon.&nbsp; And in that same burst of violence, it appears that a law enforcement officer was stabbed to death.&nbsp; Has the White House been briefed on what happened?&nbsp; What can you share as to what occurred today?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We’re, of course, in close touch with Pentagon officials.&nbsp; My colleague, John Kirby, will be briefing at the Pentagon and sharing more details on their end.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t have additional details to share publicly, as the next of kin is still being notified.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Does the White House have a message for the women who came forward with these accusations against the governor?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The White House’s message, the President&#8217;s message, the Vice President&#8217;s message, my message is: All womens [sic] who have &#8212; who have lived through sexual &#8212; this type of &#8212; this type of experience, whether it is harassment or abuse or, in the worst case, assault, deserve to have their voices heard, deserve to be treated with respect and with dignity.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I don&#8217;t know that anyone could have watched this morning and not found the allegations to be abhorrent.&nbsp; I know I certainly did.&nbsp; And, again, the President will speak to this later this afternoon.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; And staying in New York, but on COVID, if you will: New York announced today that indoor diners, people who go to gyms, entertainment venues are going to have to show some sort of proof of vaccination.&nbsp; Is that a move that this White House supports?&nbsp; And does this amount to a vaccine passport?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, we know and recognize, Cecilia, that different communities and states are going to take steps to protect the people living in their states and also incentivize, whether it&#8217;s through carrots or sticks, more people getting vaccinated.&nbsp; That is what is going to save lives, and that is what is going to bring an end to the pandemic.&nbsp; This is certainly an example of that.<br>&nbsp;<br>We are not issuing federal passports &#8212; vaccine passports from the federal government, but we do know that private sector entities and other localities will make their own decisions.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>What we see as our objective is to continue to make the vaccine as accessible and available, and close the disparities that we see among racial groups in New York &#8212; including in New York &#8212; to ensure that this is not a barrier for entry to different groups based on socioeconomic or other factors.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just one really quick one on COVID.&nbsp; San Francisco is now offering supplemental Pfizer or Moderna shots to folks who had the J&amp;J vaccine.&nbsp; Is that something that this administration endorses?&nbsp; And might we see that coming from the<br>CDC?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s not based on public health &#8212; current public health guidance provided by the CDC.&nbsp; That has not changed.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We, again, know different localities will be making decisions, but that&#8217;s not reflective of current public health guidance.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Sticking with the same topic, Governor DeSantis, in Florida, is taking a very different approach than New York is.&nbsp; Florida just hit another record today of COVID cases, and yet he&#8217;s pushing back on local municipalities that are trying to impose new mask mandates and other means of keeping people protected.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Does the White House have any reaction to Governor DeSantis, and particularly to his point that this is just seasonal in Florida because people are hot so they&#8217;re staying indoors and transmitting the vaccine &#8212; the virus.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, the data just doesn&#8217;t back that up.&nbsp; I would say, first, Florida is not the only state; seven states have both a statewide ban on mask mandates and a prohibition on school districts from requiring masks in schools.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And some states have even banned businesses and universities from requiring workers and students to be vaccinated.&nbsp; In fact, the most extreme of these measures is in Texas where you can be fined &#8212; a professor or teacher can be fined if they ask a student if they are vaccinated or if they ask unvaccinated students to wear masks.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I think the fundamental question we have is: What are we doing here?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And the President &#8212; you&#8217;ll hear the President talk a little bit about this later this afternoon.&nbsp; His message is going to be: We&#8217;re all in this fight together, whether it&#8217;s Democratic or Republican governor.&nbsp; And I will note, most Republican governors are doing exactly the right thing and doing &#8212; and advocating for &#8212; and taking steps to advocate for more people to get vaccinated.<br>&nbsp;<br>But if you aren&#8217;t going to help, if you aren&#8217;t going to abide by public health guidance, then get out of the way and let people do the right thing to lead in their communities, whether they are teachers, university leaders, private sector leaders, or others who are trying to save lives.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And beyond sending messages like the President will do later today, what is the administration doing to actually communicate or work directly with some of these state officials?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, I would first say that we are continuing to send surge teams out and we are in touch with a range of states and leaders in those states about how we can provide assistance that&#8217;s going to help them directly.&nbsp; So let me give you an example &#8212; or a couple of examples, I should say &#8212; of some of the states that have been hardest hit.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;ve actively been engaged with the governor&#8217;s office in Florida to describe and offer federal support in areas like testing; increasing vaccine confidence; monitoring hospital capacity, which we&#8217;ve seen the Florida Hospital Association speak &#8212; speak to their concerns about the rising numbers; and monoclonal antibody therapeutics.&nbsp; Teams from CDC and HHS are in contact with Florida officials to offer technical assistance and support.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;re also engaged with the governor&#8217;s office in Texas and the state health department to discuss the state of the pandemic there and how we can offer specific assistance, as well as Louisiana.&nbsp; I mean, you saw the governor make an announcement about masks yesterday.&nbsp; But as a part of our National Disaster Medical System program, we&#8217;ve deployed a team of 33 medical personnel to provide medical staff surge capacity to the Baton Rouge, Louisiana, area.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So those are just a couple of examples of some of the hardest-hit states.&nbsp; But we, again &#8212; Jeff Zients, our COVID coordinator, sent out a letter to all 50 governors, offering federal assistance, offering assistance, and offering to work in close touch about how we can help address the needs they have.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, just quickly: You keep using the word “offer,” and I just want to know whether those offers have been accepted in Florida and Texas.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Right now, it&#8217;s a discussion, and we are talking about what their needs are and how we could help meet their needs.&nbsp; Louisiana, of course, has a &#8212; has &#8212; we have sent out and deployed this &#8212; this Disaster Medical Assistance Team of 33 medical personnel.&nbsp; But ideally, we will come to agreement on how we can provide additional assistance to help address parts of the country where there are rising case numbers.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President has ruled out additional shutdowns related to COVID-19.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m just curious because that was an intervention that was used successfully to help places like New York City when they had hospital capacity issues.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Now we see hospitalization rates at their highest level since February.&nbsp; Why would you, why would the White House, why would the President rule that out?&nbsp; And is that consistent with your commitment to be led by science rather than politics?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say it’s not just the President.&nbsp; One, he continues to be guided by science.&nbsp; Dr. Fauci and Dr. Collins also made similar comments this weekend.&nbsp; And the larger point they were making is we&#8217;re in a very different place now than we were last January.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>A, the Delta variant is the most transmissible.&nbsp; We are seeing rising case numbers in a specific &#8212; about a handful of states &#8212; about half a dozen states across the country.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I will note, since we were just talking about Florida &#8212; and this statistic really struck me, so let me share it with all of you, if I can find it here.&nbsp; One second.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; That approximately 50,000 of the &#8212; 50 percent of the 50,000 hospitalizations in the country came from just four states, with Florida being nearly a quarter of those.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So that&#8217;s relevant because what we&#8217;re seeing is rises in a set number of states.&nbsp; That&#8217;s one of the reasons why this surge capacity could certainly help in specific states and communities where they need help.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>What the &#8212; what we have ruled out is a across-the-board federal vaccine mandate.&nbsp; We are now at a point where more than 165 million people are fully vaccinated.&nbsp; Seventy percent of adults have gotten at least one shot.&nbsp; That is a different place than we were six months ago.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So I think that is a reflection of the science and medical experts conveying we&#8217;ve made enough progress.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not a &#8212; not a step they believe we would need from a public health perspective.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there was an announcement yesterday about the continuation of Title 42 with regard to migrants and the public health situation at the border.&nbsp; Is there data showing that migrants are showing up with more COVID-positive rates?&nbsp; And is that what&#8217;s kind of led to that policy?&nbsp; Because we still have other people who are coming into the country by other means and we haven’t seen fit to prevent them from entering.&nbsp; So, why this treatment specifically for migrants?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would certainly point you to the CDC.&nbsp; They, of course, make the decisions and recommendations about maintaining Title 42 and keeping it in place.&nbsp; It&#8217;s rooted in preventing the introduction of contagious diseases into the interior of the United States.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We certainly do, as we talked about yesterday, have specific protocols as it relates to unaccompanied children and also as it relates to, you know, even adults who come to our border.&nbsp; But they have not made a decision to lift Title 42 because they feel there&#8217;s an ongoing threat.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Just one more issue.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve heard a lot of, kind of, anecdotal reports about U.S. businesses that are struggling in terms of their trade relations in China, their ability to do business in China.&nbsp; And I just wanted to see if you had a status update on the review that the administration has been doing since your earliest days about &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; On tariffs?<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On tariffs, on trade policy toward China.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I do not have an update for you.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t believe there is one.&nbsp; It&#8217;s ongoing.&nbsp; But I will check and see, Trevor, if there’s anything to report to you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead, Kelly.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Typically you need the governor of a state to welcome in federal resources.&nbsp; Are there other ways where the White House or the administration could surge to Florida using military bases or federal property or something else that would not require an invitation from the governor?&nbsp; Is that part of the discussion?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s a really good question.&nbsp; We work &#8212; beyond governors, who we certainly work with &#8212; Democrats and Republicans &#8212; we also work with local public health officials and authorities.&nbsp; There is a variety of kinds of assistance we can provide, whether it is medical advice or guidance on operational capacity and approaches &#8212; certainly something we can do with localities.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Businesses have also taken steps, and we&#8217;ve also &#8212; we stay attuned with that and stay in touch with them about the best steps that we can take.&nbsp; I would have to check and see.&nbsp; I think you&#8217;re referring to the requ- &#8212; you know, acceptance or request of FEMA assistance, which I don&#8217;t believe these surge teams are under FEMA.&nbsp; But I can check and see on that question.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would the administration support, in areas where hospitals find that they&#8217;re overloaded, making any medical decision based on vaccination status or insurers deciding about paying medical bills based on vaccination status?&nbsp; Are we going to reach that point?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would have to talk to our health team, but I&#8217;m not aware of that being under discussion.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, following up on that rule in New York now where the mayor says if you&#8217;re not vaccinated, you can&#8217;t go to an indoor restaurant, a gym, or a show.&nbsp; Does the White House think that that is fair to people who may have a religious reason for not wanting the vaccine or who might just be waiting for the FDA to approve it fully before they get it?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The administration and the White House and the President support steps by localities to take steps to protect people in their states and their communities to incentivize people getting vaccinated.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know all the specific details, if they have exemptions, so I&#8217;d point you to them.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then, I know that the President is going to speak a little bit about his thoughts on this Attorney General report in New York.&nbsp; In February, he invited Governor Cuomo to the White House for the next governor&#8217;s conference.&nbsp; Does that invitation still stand?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think I&#8217;ll let the President speak to his views later this afternoon.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then, the Justice Department recently dropped its civil rights investigation into Governor Cuomo’s handling of the COVID nursing home deaths.&nbsp; Does the administration want the Justice Department to initiate a civil rights investigation into these harassment allegations revealed today?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We do something new here that feels foreign from the last four years and allow the Justice Department to act independently on investigations.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then the New York Attorney General says, about the Cuomo accusers, “I believe them.”&nbsp; Does the President believe them?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, the President is going to speak to this later this afternoon, so I will point to &#8212; to his comments and I&#8217;m sure you will all be tuning in.&nbsp; He also said he&#8217;d take some questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; The Senate Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer, said today that the Senate should expect to stay in session until the infrastructure bill is done.&nbsp; Is it still your expectation that the President will travel to Rehoboth at the end of the week, even if the Senate is still in session?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; The President&#8217;s travel has not changed.&nbsp; But as you have seen the President do over the last several weeks and months, he is ready and &#8212; ready to be called into action, whether it&#8217;s a phone call or bringing people to the White House or to meet in the Oval Office, and that remains the case as we work to get this infrastructure bill across the finish line.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to ask you a question about yesterday&#8217;s news about the eviction moratorium.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gene Sperling said yesterday, several times, that the President would do everything in his power to help people who face eviction.&nbsp; One power the President has in the Constitution is to convene a House of Congress if it&#8217;s not in session.&nbsp; Is that something the President would consider &#8212; bringing the House back?&nbsp; It’s out for seven weeks while this issue is lingering and the White House has already asked Congress to act.&nbsp; Why not do what Harry Truman did in 1948: bring the Congress back and say, “You can&#8217;t go on vacation until this issue is resolved”?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think the key here is you need the votes in order to support a piece of legislation passing.&nbsp; I am not a vote counter, but I would point you to the Lead- &#8212; the Speaker&#8217;s office to see if that exists.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But I will say what the President was referring to is his ask over the weekend of the CDC to look into any legal authority, any option they have &#8212; perhaps a narrower approach, perhaps a short-term extension.&nbsp; This was never meant to be permanent, as we know.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what you need legislation for.&nbsp; And to see what is possible.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are continuing to do that.&nbsp; I will certainly leave it to them to make any announcements about what they have found.<br>&nbsp;<br>I will note that one of the steps that he has really pressed his policy team on, that Gene spoke to yesterday, are the states getting this money out into their communities because there is enough money out there for states across the country to extend the eviction moratorium from a state level, even without federal action.<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#8217;ve seen Texas provide over $300 million in rental and utility assistance in June alone and has distributed most of the assistance.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a positive step forward.<br>&nbsp;<br>Virginia has distributed the second-most assistance and has implemented efforts to address incomplete applications with outreach phone calls.<br>&nbsp;<br>Illinois did not report making any assistance payments between January and May, but delivered over $95 million in utility and rental assistance in June alone.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, I use this as an example because there&#8217;s a great deal &#8212; tens of billions of dollars &#8212; that can still be spent by states.&nbsp; It is too slow.&nbsp; We made some progress in June, but we&#8217;re really pressing states to get this money out and to extend the eviction moratorium from a state level.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a couple on eviction, but, to start with, you mentioned the MPD officers who tragically passed away.&nbsp; The Senate just cleared a bill giving Congressional Gold Medals to everybody who responded on January 6th.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the President signs that, are you guys considering inviting any of the officers to the White House?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It is a great question.&nbsp; I have not talked to the President about that specifically, but let me see if we can get more information on that this afternoon.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then, two quick ones on eviction.&nbsp; I’m mercifully not a lawyer &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Me neither.&nbsp; There may be some in here.&nbsp; I don’t know.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very disappointing to my parents.&nbsp; But the &#8212; in terms of the legal analysis, based on where &#8212; I understand what you guys are saying on what Kavanaugh put in his opinion, but that does not change the fact that, as it currently stands, the President can extend if he wants to.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, I guess, my question, from a legal basis is: Is the advice that Dana and the Justice Department are giving based on the fact of being concerned more about having the CDC’s emergency powers reduced if you go down this pathway, or is it because &#8212; I guess I&#8217;ll just stop there.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; I am mercifully not a lawyer, either.&nbsp; I would say we&#8217;re both doing okay to our parents, hopefully.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But I will tell you that &#8212; from a legal standpoint, I would note that, in June &#8212; at the end of June, the Supreme Court came out and they &#8212; they put a stay on the moratorium and made clear in their public writing, as Gene referenced yesterday, which is available to everybody, that any further action would need legislative steps forward.<br>&nbsp;<br>We also indicated, as a result, that the third extension of the moratorium that the CDC has &#8212; did since January would be the last extension.<br>&nbsp;<br>In addition, there are concerns about what the impact could be on the long-term capacity abilities &#8212; authorities, I should say, of the CDC.&nbsp; Their team is looking closely, carefully &#8212; their legal team &#8212; has been since the President asked them to on Sunday at what our options are here.&nbsp; That was a broad federal moratorium.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>There had been good questions raised about whether it can be more limited.&nbsp; That was in our statement yesterday, especially given the rise of the Delta variant, which we&#8217;ve seen and has really raised concerns for everybody &#8212; us, from members of Congress, from many advocates over the past several weeks.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, they are taking a close look at that or they have been taking close look at that.&nbsp; But there is &#8212; there&#8217;s been a range of legal factors, and they&#8217;re taking a &#8212; they&#8217;re kicking the tires.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then, just one more to follow up on that.&nbsp; Speaker Pelosi’s statement after your statement yesterday made pretty clear the enthusiasm was based on the fact you guys are still looking for legal options &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yep.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; which Gene was pretty clear last night the tires that have been kicked up to that point had presented none of them.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I guess, my question is: I don’t understand how this ends.&nbsp; You made very clear the reality: There&#8217;s no votes on Capitol Hill.&nbsp; This is a huge issue inside the House Democratic Caucus, and you guys don&#8217;t think you have the legal authority.&nbsp; How does this end?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We do hard things.&nbsp; It&#8217;s challenging.<br>&nbsp;<br>I will say there are a couple of options here.&nbsp; We are still continuing to look at legal options.&nbsp; That process has not concluded.<br>&nbsp;<br>And again, I would note that, in our statement yesterday, we made clear that the President even raised the question of a partial, limited, short-term extension.&nbsp; This was never going to be permanent, right?&nbsp; It was never intended to be.<br>&nbsp;<br>The other piece, which I touched on briefly in response to Steve&#8217;s &#8212; or I think it was Steve’s question &#8212; was related to what states can do.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s no question that there’s a great deal of funding that has not gone out nearly as quickly as it should have gone out.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We recognize that issue.&nbsp; We are quite focused on that issue.&nbsp; And one of the efforts that we feel we do have some control over is pushing states to extend moratoriums in their own states.&nbsp; They have the funding to do it.&nbsp; The funding comes from the American Rescue Plan.&nbsp; They need to get it out the door.&nbsp; That should help keep many people in their homes.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, we are &#8212; we are continuing to work on several tracks on this front.&nbsp; The President wants to keep people in their homes.&nbsp; He does not want people to be out on the street, and he&#8217;s going to do everything in his power, even with the challenges you outlined, to get that done.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to use the phrase “kicking the tires” &#8212; although, I just did.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You can &#8212; you just used it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We can keep it as a theme.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foiled again.&nbsp; Okay.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Lifting the hood.&nbsp; Whatever you say.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There you go.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Should we expect anything from the President later in terms of a partial, limited, short-term extension?&nbsp; Is he going to give an update on anything related to evictions at 4:00?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would say that any announcement &#8212; any decision and announcement would be made by the CDC.&nbsp; And then, if &#8212; if they find there is capacity or steps they can &#8212; that they can take from a legal standpoint, I&#8217;m sure this President would speak to it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And there was a report yesterday in Politico that a senior aide in this White House has been abusive to other colleagues.&nbsp; I know the report was based on anonymous sourcing, but &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; You know how I love anonymous sources &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s why I almost didn’t ask because I feel like you would just say &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; &#8212; placing criticism.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; But, I’m wondering if, given this administration has its edict to treating people with kindness and respect, is this report, even though anonymously sourced, going to be looked into?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; First, I would say that I&#8217;ve worked with now, over the last six months, even as a newbie into the Biden orbit, the individual named by anonymous source.&nbsp; He&#8217;s been nothing but supportive and communicative, and that&#8217;s been my experience.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, it&#8217;s hard to look into “anonymously sourced reports.”&nbsp; I&#8217;m not aware of that being the intention.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; In July, we likely saw a record &#8212; a record high of unaccompanied children &#8212; again, a monthly high &#8212; arriving at the southern border.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ve already reached a yearly high of migrants who’ve arrived at the border.&nbsp; You all have previously explained this was likely due to a seasonal spike that we&#8217;ve seen, but we&#8217;re well out of what we would normally see on a yearly average.&nbsp; What is your current assessment for why we&#8217;re seeing these numbers still well into a very hot summer?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;ve &#8212; we’ve said that was one of the factors, and it is typically one of the factors seasonally.&nbsp; We saw a big uptick in the spring, which you see every other year or so.&nbsp; You know, I will say there&#8217;s a range of factors, which are happening in these countries where individuals are leaving from &#8212; economic challenges, weather challenges, crime &#8212; and that is&nbsp;&#8212; those are also, of course, drivers of people of all ages trying to leave their country to come to the United States.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That&#8217;s one of the reasons the Vice President has been so focused, at the President&#8217;s asking, on addressing these root causes.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a long-term &#8212; a long-term challenge and a long &#8212; will require a long-term solution.&nbsp; She laid out some significant steps forward last week, and that is going to continue to be something she is working on.<br>&nbsp;<br>But I will note that, you know, even &#8212; even with the uptick we&#8217;ve seen over the last several months, as we&#8217;ve noted, Title 42 remains in place for health reasons.&nbsp; We also have made great progress in moving people through Border Patrol facilities &#8212; especially, of course, children &#8212; and getting them into places where they can be treated with safety, safely.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, one other question.&nbsp; The Senate Homeland Security Committee released a report this morning that found serious cybersecurity vulnerabilities all across the federal government.&nbsp; The average rating they gave was C-minus.&nbsp; It was &#8212; a lot of work &#8212; a lot of different agencies got B&#8217;s.&nbsp; Does the White House agree with that assessment?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And then, is &#8212; as Senator Portman stressed, are you all willing to take some of the considerations or recommendations that they put in the report into account?&nbsp; For instance, creating a coordinating body or just requiring more stringent cybersecurity regulations around &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I have not taken a look at the report nor &#8212; and I&#8217;m not aware if our team has or not, but I&#8217;m happy to see if they have a reaction to it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Why don&#8217;t I go to the back just so I can jump around.&nbsp; Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; I wanted to follow up on the question of lockdowns from a second ago because, you know, yesterday, you said that we are not going back to the shutdowns of March 2020.&nbsp; You also said that, quote, “We&#8217;re not going to take options off the table.”&nbsp; Given how incredibly effective the vaccine is, why not take lockdowns off the table?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I think I also said that that’s not under consideration.&nbsp; That hasn&#8217;t changed.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for clarifying.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay, go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes. &nbsp;Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; The administration today announced its allocation plan for the first 25 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to be shared globally.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Mm-hmm.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;ve asked this before in a different forum but &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; what is the guidance the administration has for the as many as 9 million American citizens overseas that are still waiting for a vaccine dose?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I know you’ve asked this before, and it is incumbent and upon us to get you a good answer.&nbsp; Obviously, our embassies are fully in touch with American citizens who are living overseas, but it&#8217;s probably best suited for the State Department to answer that question, given they oversee all of our diplomatic efforts.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; Oh, go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You said that &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; (Inaudible) your tie looks good though.&nbsp; (Laughs.)<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; You’ve said that the administration supports New York City or locality steps to, you know, do what they need to to keep their residents safe.&nbsp; Given the success that foreign countries have had in mandating vaccines &#8212; obviously, New York is taking this step &#8212; has there been any more discussion inside the White House about encouraging &#8212; actively encouraging city and states to take steps like New York did today?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We work very closely with governors and localities about what steps they&#8217;re considering and what steps are appropriate to help protect people in their localities and save more lives.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have anything &#8212; any additional considerations to preview for you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the President is not going to weigh in one way or the other whether he supports mandating vaccines in the way that, you know, other countries have?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We support steps by private sector entities.&nbsp; We support steps by localities to save lives, protect their communities, incentivize more people getting vaccinated.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then just one more on the eviction moratoriums.&nbsp; Does the President have any plans to speak with Representative Bush or any of the other lawmakers that are outside the Capitol?&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the Representative spoke with the Vice President yesterday as she was in the Capitol, but does the President have any plans to speak with her?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have any plans to preview for you.&nbsp; I &#8212; as you noted, the Vice President was leaving the Capitol yesterday, and she spoke briefly with Representative Bush.&nbsp; We are in regular touch with a range of members of the Progressive Caucus on a number of issues, including, of course, this important issue.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We were in la- &#8212; late last week, into the weekend, and yesterday, White House officials were in touch with Speaker Pelosi, various members, including Representatives Cori Bush, as I noted; Representative Jayapal; Gomez; Pressley; and the CPC Executive Director.<br>&nbsp;<br>And Representative Bush certainly shared firsthand her firsthand account of being evicted, and explained what this meant to her, which is something that stuck with the people she spoke with.<br>&nbsp;<br>So we will remain in close touch.&nbsp; That will continue.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have a call to preview for you at this point in time.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; The White House has stressed that it&#8217;s following the health and the science when it comes to COVID-19, and that has been the basis for the ongoing international travel restrictions.&nbsp; But what is the health or scientific basis for the travel restrictions on vaccinated individuals from Europe or Canada or other nations, when people who are unvaccinated from other countries are allowed to come into the United States?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I would certainly point you to our health and medical teams who make these decisions and evaluate what we need to do, from a public health perspective, to keep the American people safe at a time where the Delta variant is rising, and one where we are very cognizant about keeping the American people safe.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a quick follow-up on that.&nbsp; When it comes to countries that have more vaccinated individuals than the United States does at this point as a percentage of population, what is the basis for those restrictions?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Again, I would point you to our public health officials who are leading this effort and determining when we can raise or end those restrictions.&nbsp; I certainly understand there&#8217;s a desire to do that by many people in the United States, many people around the world.&nbsp; We understand that.&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t have an update on it and when that will happen.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; It was just a little over a month ago that the President traveled down to Surfside.&nbsp; He actually sat side by side with Governor DeSantis.&nbsp; They both praised one another for their respective handling of the disaster situation there.&nbsp; I&#8217;m wondering if there has been any further direct communication between the President and the governor.&nbsp; And might the President consider speaking with the governor specifically about what we&#8217;re seeing in terms of the rise in the hospitalizations and this developing situation with COVID down there?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, if it &#8212; we thought it would make a difference, I&#8217;m sure he would.&nbsp; But I would say that the President feels you can praise leaders for taking some steps &#8212; as he did in that scenario with that tragedy at Surfside where many people&#8217;s lives were lost, many families were suffering &#8212; while at the same time expressing concern about their handling of a pandemic, which is what we&#8217;re doing in this regard.<br>&nbsp;<br>But I don&#8217;t have any expectation or prediction of a call between them.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hasn’t shied away from calling out, for instance, social media companies for their roles in the spread of disinformation, for instance.&nbsp; Does he feel that Governor DeSantis bears responsibility for a situation with regard to hospitalizations that is an outlier compared to the rest of the country?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think you&#8217;ll hear him talk this afternoon about where he&#8217;s seeing the biggest challenges in the country.&nbsp; But I think any call we make, we do through the prism of what we think is going to result in action and result in a positive outcome.&nbsp; And their calling out social media companies and the fact that they can take additional steps is one thing, but we certainly are still open to working with governors of all political stripes to help address the pandemic.&nbsp; And our objective and our hope would be to work in partnership and not get into a food fight.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Oh, go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You want to go ahead?&nbsp; And then I’ll go.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Yeah, that&#8217;s fine.&nbsp; Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; There&#8217;s been a second incident involving oil tankers off the Gulf of Oman today.&nbsp; Fingers pointed to Iran.&nbsp; Do you believe that Iran is threatening international shipping line?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And today, Iran has &#8212; the new president has taken office.&nbsp; Do you think that the White House can work with the hardliners, especially that we still don&#8217;t know if you guys are going to go to the seventh round of talks in Vienna?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, first, we&#8217;re monitoring this developing situation, and we are in close touch with London and other partners who &#8212; around the world who are also monitoring.&nbsp; The first reports are deeply concerning.&nbsp; We are fully engaged, and will be, as the situation is developing.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I would say that, as it relates to whether we can work with &#8212; I think our view, as I mentioned yesterday, is that every single challenge and threat we face from Iran would be made more pronounced and dangerous by an unconstrained nuclear program that continues. &nbsp;We would not anticipate that would solve every concern we have about their behavior in the world, but we believe that having greater visibility into their nuclear capacity and capabilities would be in our national interest, in the interests of many of our partners. &nbsp;And certainly, we would hope we could build from there. &nbsp;But, you know, we are fully prepared to return to Vienna to continue negotiations and hope that is the &#8212; there&#8217;s an opportunity to do that.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to the two ladies behind you.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to ask about the infrastructure bill &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; specifically the Reconnecting Communities Program that’s in there.&nbsp; The President asked for at least $20 billion &#8212; with a “B” &#8212; in the American Jobs Plan, and the bill has it at $1 billion.&nbsp; I wanted to ask if that&#8217;s enough to do what you want with the program or reach the program&#8217;s goals, and if you&#8217;re going to pursue funding for it through another path.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, well, I would first say that major project funding can be used for these kinds of efforts, which are certainly a priority to the President.&nbsp; And this is the first time in American history that the federal government has taken on the effects of the 20th century practice of placing roads or other infrastructure in ways that deliberately interrupt the hearts of Black communities, like what happened in New Orleans, Syracuse, and cities across the country.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, we are &#8212; certainly I know the President proposed a greater amount of money; part of coming to an agreement is compromise.&nbsp; But we also believe that project funding for other projects that&#8217;s a part of this package could be used to address, you know, the division of communities and further our equity objectives.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So would you then &#8212; and some of the programs are grant funding or something &#8212; would you prioritize reconnecting communities to be able to use that funding for the purpose that you wanted?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, that&#8217;s &#8212; we&#8217;re kind of not at that point right now.&nbsp; But I certainly think there is room for funds from project funding that is included in this package to help address this key priority of the President&#8217;s.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead, Shelby.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; So, I wanted to ask about the New York City proof of vaccination.&nbsp; So, New York City data shows that the rate for Black New Yorkers is sitting at 31 percent, which is a lot lower than some of the other percentages.&nbsp; And this is similar to the national level, according to CDC data.&nbsp; So is the White House concerned at all that the burdens imposed by governments and businesses, like this New York City proof of vaccination, is going to fall heaviest on these minority communities?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say, Shelby, that it&#8217;s our objective to continue to close that equity gap and to make sure we are, as a federal government, working in partnership with city &#8212; or states like New York, cities like New York City, to make sure we are making the vaccine accessible, available; we&#8217;re meeting people where they are; we&#8217;re partnering with the right public health officials.&nbsp; And we will continue to do exactly that, because we certainly don&#8217;t want this to be a barrier of entry for communities.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We also believe that at a time where the Delta variant is spreading like wildfire across the country, especially to unvaccinated communities, that it&#8217;s important and country &#8212; cities and communities should be able to take steps to incentivize, get more people getting vaccinated.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a question on the eviction moratorium.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some states are reporting a lot of logistical problems in dispersing their funds, from websites getting overloaded and crashing to renters not being able to track down all the verification documents.&nbsp; What is this administration doing or what can it do to make the process easier, streamline it, less difficult &#8212; make it easier for the states to disperse the funds?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah, look, I would say, as Gene touched on yesterday, there is &#8212; long before this question about extending the eviction moratorium during a pandemic, there have been a lot of challenges and issues with our infrastructure as it relates to rental and housing assistance across the country.&nbsp; And this is really bringing that to light.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>What we have tried to do is work with states in partnership to share best practices.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve hosted two summits with 46 of the cities with most tenants at risk to help jurisdictions set up these new eviction prevention programs.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We also have a range of experts and officials in the federal government who are here to provide assistance and guidance on how this money can get out.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen some progress over the last month; obviously, more needs to be done.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But we are here.&nbsp; We are available.&nbsp; We are ready to provide assistance, to provide guidance to states and localities that need that.&nbsp; We want to work in partnership.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead, in the back.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, can you first tell us: Is there any progress on finding an ambassador to the Holy See?&nbsp; And if so, what qualifications are you looking for?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI: &nbsp;I don&#8217;t have anything to preview for you at this point in time.&nbsp; I understand there&#8217;s still an ongoing interest in ambassadors.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;ll be more to come very soon, if not &#8212; if not later today.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll see.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead, in the back.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, I mean, it feels like we&#8217;re dancing around an issue here, which is: How much are Governors DeSantis and Abbott directly responsible for what&#8217;s happening right now, given that 50 million people live in those two states that are &#8212; I think Jeff said yesterday &#8212; one third of all infections last week were there?&nbsp; So, how much personal responsibility do they bear?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m certainly not trying to dance in any way.&nbsp; I think what I said yesterday was that at a point in every leader’s life, they have to make a decision about whether they&#8217;re going to abide by public health guidelines to save people&#8217;s lives or whether we&#8217;re going to be guided by politics.&nbsp; And I will let you all be the judge of that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Public health guidelines are pretty clear as it relates to the benefit of vaccination, as it relates to the benefit of masking for communities that are not vaccinated.&nbsp; And you&#8217;ll hear the President convey later: If you are not going to be a part of the solution, if you&#8217;re not going to be a part of saving people&#8217;s lives, then get out of the way and let other people do the job.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you mean by “Get out of the way”?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That means don&#8217;t ban, don&#8217;t make it harder for people to put requirements on masks or asking for vaccination status into law. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Let&#8217;s see.&nbsp; Go ahead, Eugene.&nbsp; And then we&#8217;ll go to you next.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no (inaudible).&nbsp; I don’t have a metaphor for you on &#8212; (laughs) &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; That&#8217;s okay.&nbsp; You don’t need one.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has the President or anyone from the White House been in contact with Republican senators and leadership over there to talk about the eviction moratorium?&nbsp; We’ve been talking about the House a lot.&nbsp; Obviously, you know, they are the ones that are sleeping outside of the Capitol, but it would take 10 votes from Republicans also to get an eviction moratorium.&nbsp; Are you guys in contact with leadership?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We are in contact with Republicans and Democrats about a range of issues, and we certainly welcome anyone in the Republican caucus who wants to work together on an eviction moratorium.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the President calling on the Senate to take it up &#8212; an eviction moratorium?&nbsp; Because they are in session.&nbsp; They&#8217;re still here.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That would also require &#8212; yes, as you said, it would also require Congress to act.&nbsp; You need both houses to act.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Again, I think this is a matter of whether there is support in caucuses to do that.&nbsp; That is a challenge.&nbsp; Even the most passionate advocates who are out there &#8212; and we certainly stand by them and support their same objective of extending the eviction moratorium &#8212; cannot do it on their own.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We certainly would like to see legislation.&nbsp; The President would love to sign that into law.&nbsp; That, as you said, would require both houses of Congress.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And my last question, sorry.&nbsp; The &#8212; you mentioned Texas &#8212; that&#8217;s the state that is being touted as not just being number one, but also they have the best system.&nbsp; The way that it&#8217;s been happening is it&#8217;s going straight to landlords and people who own homes and are renting it out.&nbsp; Is that what other states should be doing?&nbsp; Should they be copying Texas in how they disburse these funds?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Different &#8212; different approaches are going to work for different states.&nbsp; But I do think, if Texas can do it, if Virginia can do it, then other states can do it as well.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And one of our objectives is connecting leaders, connecting to share best practices to figure out how they can get this assistance out to renters.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s no question it is challenging.&nbsp; There isn&#8217;t a great national infrastructure in place.&nbsp; That&#8217;s something that we should have a conversation about too, and Gene talked about that yesterday.<br>&nbsp;<br>But, right now, we wanted to lift up and highlight states where they are getting the money out effectively because they can be models for other states around the country.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Real quick, a couple of different topics.&nbsp; The first: the President&#8217;s effort in &#8212; to preventing evictions in states that are tremendously affected.&nbsp; You mentioned that there were incentives to some of the landlords who cooperate with the efforts, but I didn&#8217;t see what those incentives are.&nbsp; And are there repercussions if we later find that money goes unused and is &#8212; or is diverted to something else?&nbsp; That&#8217;s my question on &#8212; for &#8212; on evictions.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, certainly, if money was not used for its intended purpose, that would be a concern.&nbsp; And certainly, we are &#8212; take waste, fraud, and abuse quite seriously.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I think the President had called for a number of steps &#8212; or we called for, I should say, a number of steps that could be taken, even as we&#8217;re pressing and kicking the tires &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; looking for all of our legal options, even as we&#8217;re doing that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And I mentioned the states because there is a lot of money that can go out in states and can effectively go out.&nbsp; And a number of states &#8212; not all blue states &#8212; have done that very effectively.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, I referenced &#8212; and you touched on one of them, but let me make sure I cover it.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s see.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, there are states and communities.&nbsp; You know, there are also &#8212; he&#8217;s also asked federal agencies to use their power to prevent evictions and tell landlords.&nbsp; So, we have &#8212; so there are &#8212; any properties that are government-backed properties &#8212; so, if you get a government-backed loan for your mortgage, we&#8217;ve asked our agencies to prevent eviction.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, he is, again, using every step in his capacity to keep people in their homes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On voting rights: Senator Klobuchar says that they&#8217;re nearing a voting rights deal.&nbsp; Is there anything that you can tell us in the deal &#8212; how the slimmed-down deal is looking?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And also, the President has also talked about &#8212; there are Republicans that he has been talking to.&nbsp; Are there &#8212; can you name any of the Republicans that, possibly could be &#8212;<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That wouldn&#8217;t be constructive to our end goal.&nbsp; I understand your interest.&nbsp; I will say that, you know, we&#8217;re certainly grateful for Senator Klobuchar&#8217;s work, the ongoing work by a range of leaders to figure out if there&#8217;s a path forward here.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll let them speak to the details when they&#8217;re ready to.&nbsp; And once they do, I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have more to say.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then lastly, the New York Times reported, a couple of weeks ago, that the administration&#8217;s legal team advisors may be leaning towards returning the 4,000 on home confinement back to prison.&nbsp; Is there anything that we have coming from the administration on this?&nbsp; And does the administration really believe that it is easier to return those 4,000 people to federal prison than reviewing clemency petitions for them?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I would say: One, that&#8217;s a DOJ action.&nbsp; So, I&#8217;d point you to them, in terms of what their steps are.&nbsp; And certainly, any decision about clemency would be made in coordination, but I have nothing to preview on that front.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jen, we&#8217;re told you have an out soon.&nbsp; Just one or two more.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Of course.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nikki, go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know if the President has spoken with Governor Cuomo today?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; No, he has not.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, just a quick scheduling thing.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know if he will go to Mike Enzi&#8217;s funeral on Friday?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to preview for you. &nbsp;I understand the interest.&nbsp; He did consider him a friend, but I don&#8217;t think a decision has been made quite yet.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Raquel, go ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thank you so much, Jen.&nbsp; More than a million doses of vaccine expired and have gone to waste since December.&nbsp; What is the White House doing to avoid this waste?&nbsp; And could the U.S. be donating more vaccines to other countries and faster?&nbsp; And will President Biden soon announce more vaccines shared to the world?<br>&nbsp;<br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, yes, he will announce this afternoon &#8212; that&#8217;s what his remarks are about &#8212; getting 110 million doses out.&nbsp; We also announced our purchase of 500 million Pfizer doses.&nbsp; He will talk about all of that this afternoon.<br>&nbsp;<br>I will just note, to give you just a little bit of a preview: He will also say that this work is just beginning.&nbsp; While we are &#8212; the United States remains &#8212; with the announcement today, we have &#8212; we will have donated to &#8212; more to the world than all of the countries in the U.N., including Russia and China, combined.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And this is just the beginning.&nbsp; We are going to continue to be a provider of vaccines and assistance to the global community in our fight against COVID.&nbsp; So, he will certainly talk about that today.&nbsp; And so, yes, there &#8212; there will certainly be more to come.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Let me note though for you on the &#8212; on the question you asked, Raquel, about waste: The COVID vaccine wastage rate nationally is approximately 2.6 percent, which is very low.&nbsp; Certainly, we don&#8217;t want any doses to be wasted.&nbsp; And what we do is we work with governors so that they can request &#8212; or state authorities, I should say &#8212; exactly the amount of vaccine doses that they want to reduce and prevent that waste.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s important that we get as many people, of course, vaccinated.&nbsp; And sometimes that can mean opening a multi-dose vial and not using every dose, but we &#8212; we do everything we can to reduce waste.&nbsp; And certainly, we will continue to do that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>All right, thanks everyone.<br>&nbsp;<br>3:06 P.M. EDT</p>

<p>Today, the President and Vice President met with 12 Latino leaders to discuss the Build Back Better Agenda and this Administration’s commitment to equity. During the meeting, the President and Vice President reiterated their promise to invest in Latino families and businesses across the country as we work to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic downfall that resulted from it. The President and Vice President discussed their belief in the American Dream and the promise of America for all, and they vowed to continue working to strengthen our democracy and protect voting rights. Two years after the El Paso massacre, they vowed to keep fighting against the most lethal terrorist threat to our homeland – domestic terrorism rooted in white supremacy, hate-fueled violence in all forms, and the scourge of gun violence in America. President Biden and Vice President Harris also restated their support for immigration reform in reconciliation that provides a path to citizenship for Dreamers, farm workers, TPS holders, and essential workers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>A little over a month ago, the President announced the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework—a bipartisan agreement to make the largest long-term investment in our infrastructure and competitiveness in nearly a century. This week, the Senate is considering the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a once-in-a-generation investment in our infrastructure. The bipartisan infrastructure agreement will grow the economy, enhance our competitiveness, and make our economy more sustainable, resilient, and just.</p>



<p>The agreement will also create good-paying, union jobs. With the remainder of the President’s Build Back Better Agenda, these investments will add, on average, around 2 million jobs per year over the course of the decade, while accelerating America’s path to full employment and increasing labor force participation.</p>



<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act addresses economic disparities in our economy and the consequences of decades of disinvestment in America’s infrastructure that have fallen most heavily on communities of color. Through critical investments, the legislation increases access to good-paying jobs, affordable high-speed internet, reliable public transit, clean drinking water and other resources to ensure communities of color get a fair shot at the American dream.</p>



<p>These critical investments are first steps in advancing equity and racial justice throughout our economy. The President believes additional investments are needed in our nation’s caregiving infrastructure, housing supply, regional development, and workforce development programs to ensure that communities of color and other underserved communities can access economic opportunity and justice. And, earlier this summer in Tulsa, OK, President Biden announced a whole-of-government effort to increase the share of federal contracts going to small disadvantaged businesses by 50 percent over the next five years, leveraging the government’s purchasing power to help more Americans realize their entrepreneurial dreams.</p>



<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act:</p>



<p><strong>DELIVERS HIGH SPEED INTERNET TO EVERY AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD</strong></p>



<p>There is a stark digital divide in America. Black families are 9% less likely to have high-speed internet than their white peers, and Latino Americans are 15% less likely. About 35% of individuals living on Tribal lands lack access to broadband service. Although studies suggest high levels of digital access for Asian Americans, these studies are often limited in scope and don’t identify key inequities. For example, broadband access and affordability in the Pacific Islands has long been a challenge. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were stories of kids sitting in McDonald’s parking lots to log on to remote school in parts of the country. The President believes this is unacceptable.</p>



<p>The agreement’s $65 billion investment ensures every American has access to reliable high-speed internet with an historic investment in broadband infrastructure deployment, just as the federal government made a historic effort to provide electricity to every American nearly one hundred years ago. This includes a $2 billion investment in broadband in Tribal communities which were hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>The bill will also help lower prices for internet service by requiring funding recipients to offer a low-cost affordable plan, requiring providers to display a “Broadband Nutrition Label” that will help families comparison shop for a better deal, and by boosting competition in areas where existing providers aren’t providing adequate service.</p>



<p><strong>ELIMINATES LEAD PIPES AND DELIVERS CLEAN DRINKING WATER TO EVERY HOUSEHOLD</strong></p>



<p>Across the country, pipes and treatment plants are aging and polluted drinking water is endangering public health. There are up to 10 million homes with lead service lines and pipes. Children in up to 400,000 schools and child care facilities are at risk of exposure to lead. Across the country, families of color are at the highest risk for lead exposure at home and in schools. Communities of color in cities like Chicago, Milwaukee, and Newark are also at particular risk. For kids, higher exposure to lead can negatively affect academic performance, and can lead to cardiovascular disease later in life. By some estimates, each lead service line replaced at a cost of $5,000 per line leads to $22,000 in health savings.</p>



<p>The deal makes the largest investment in clean drinking water in American history, replacing all of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines. From rural towns to struggling cities, the deal invests in water infrastructure across America, including in Tribal Nations and disadvantaged communities that need it most. The deal also includes dedicated funding to deal with the dangerous chemical PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl).</p>



<p><strong>INVESTS IN MORE PUBLIC TRANSIT OPTIONS AND ADDRESSING THE BACKLOG OF REPAIRS</strong></p>



<p>Asian American and African American workers commute by public transit at nearly 4 times the rate of white workers. For example, low-wage Black residents in Chicago spend 70 additional minutes commuting to work than their white peers. In New York City, the average Black resident spends 110 minutes more per week commuting to work than the average white resident.</p>



<p>The Framework’s historic investment in public transit—the largest federal investment in history—will reduce commute times and create more economic opportunities in communities of color. In addition, bus and transit workers are 31% Black and 19% Hispanic, compared to 12% and 18% respectively of the workforce overall.</p>



<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure deal is the largest Federal investment in public transit in history, and devotes a larger share of funds from surface transportation reauthorization to transit in the history of the programs. It will repair and upgrade aging infrastructure, modernize bus and rail fleets, make stations accessible to all users, and bring transit service to new communities. It will replace thousands of transit vehicles, including buses, with clean, zero emission vehicles.</p>



<p><strong>CREATES A FIRST-EVER PROGRAM TO RECONNECT COMMUNITIES DIVIDED BY INEQUITABLE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE</strong></p>



<p>Significantportions of the interstate highway system were built through Black neighborhoods, destroying homes, schools, churches, and parks and causing lasting disconnection and disinvestment for residents who stayed.More broadly, historic investments in transportation infrastructure, especially highway construction, cut too many Americans off from opportunity, dividing and demolishing communities, and perpetuating economic and racial injustices. The legislation creates a first-ever program to reconnect communities divided by transportation infrastructure. The program will fund planning, design, demolition, and reconstruction of street grids, parks, or other infrastructure. This is in addition to other major grant programs that could fund elements of these projects.</p>



<p><strong>ELECTRIFY SCHOOL BUSES, IMPROVING THE AIR QUALITY FOR CHILDREN</strong></p>



<p>The legislation will make a critical down payment on helping the more than 25 million children and thousands of bus drivers who breathe polluted air on their rides to and from school. Diesel air pollution is linked to asthma and other health problems that hurt our communities and cause students to miss school, particularly in communities of color and Tribal communities. The legislation will deliver thousands of electric school buses nationwide, helping school districts across the country buy clean, American-made, zero emission buses, replacing the yellow school bus fleet for America’s children.</p>



<p><strong>REMEDIATES BROWNFIELD AND SUPERFUND SITES</strong></p>



<p>Across America, 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for the overall population. Proximity to a Superfund site can lead to elevated levels of lead in children’s blood. Recent studies demonstrate that cleaning up these sites can lead to a decrease in blood levels by approximately 13-26%.</p>



<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provides the full American Jobs Plan funding level—$21 billion—to create good-paying union jobs plugging orphan oil and gas wells, cleaning up abandoned mines, and remediating Brownfield and Superfund sites. As we transition to a clean energy future, the Bipartisan Infrastructure deal will begin to remedy economic injustice for communities across the country that have relied on the fossil fuel industry and have been affected most by the impacts of climate change and pollution, including rural communities and communities of color.</p>



<p><strong>SAFEGUARDS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR FROM CLIMATE CRISES AND EXTREME WEATHER RISKS</strong></p>



<p>People of color are more likely to live in areas most vulnerable to flooding and other climate change-related weather events. For example, in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, Black and Hispanic residents were twice as likely to report lost income. Tribal lands are significantly at risk to the effects of climate change and Alaska Natives are particularly vulnerable, as they face multiple climate impacts.</p>



<p>The legislation invests in helping communities build resilience to wildfires and floods through investments in forest management and upgrades to critical infrastructure—like elevating buildings, roads, and bridges, hardening physical infrastructure, and winterizing the power grid. And, it will fund state and local infrastructure improvements and emergency response strategies, such as planning grants to support development of evacuation routes or upgrading community shelters. The legislation will also make it easier for low-income families to buy flood insurance.</p>



<p><strong>INVESTS IN CLEAN ENERGY GRID TO MITIGATE THE DISPARATE IMPACTS OF POLLUTION ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR</strong></p>



<p>Black, Latino, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and Native communities are more likely to be burdened by pollution. Black people are almost three times more likely to die from asthma related causes than their white counterparts. And more than one in three—or over 23 million—Latinos in the U.S. live in counties where the air doesn’t meet EPA public health standards for smog.</p>



<p>The legislation’s roughly $65 billion investment is the single largest investment in clean energy transmission in American history. It upgrades our power infrastructure, including by building thousands of miles of new, resilient transmission lines to facilitate the expansion of renewable energy. It creates a new Grid Deployment Authority, invests in research and development for advanced transmission and electricity distribution technologies, and promotes smart grid technologies that deliver flexibility and resilience. It invests in demonstration projects and research hubs for next generation technologies like advanced nuclear reactors, carbon capture, and clean hydrogen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Building off of last week’s announcement of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/29/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-announce-new-actions-to-get-more-americans-vaccinated-and-slow-the-spread-of-the-delta-variant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">additional actions</a> that we are taking to stop the spread of the Delta variant and get more people vaccinated in the United States, President Biden will give an update on another critical piece of his strategy to end the COVID-19 pandemic: stopping the spread of the virus abroad. As one part of our strategy to do that, the President has promised that the United States will be an arsenal of vaccines for the world and is acting with the same urgency to combat the virus abroad as here at home. Today, the President will announce that the U.S. has now donated and shipped more than 110 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccines to more than 60 countries – a major milestone that cements the United States as the global leader in COVID-19 vaccine donations.  According to the United Nations, this is more than the donations of all other countries combined and reflects the generosity of the American spirit.<br><br>In June, the President committed to donate at least 80 million vaccines from the U.S. supply to countries throughout the world, and he promised to continue to share as we are able. Today’s announcement is a fulfillment of his promise and a significant down payment on hundreds of millions of more doses that the U.S. will deliver in the coming weeks. The United States has been able to share these doses because of the aggressive action the President took when he came into office to secure enough vaccines for all Americans.  The majority of these vaccines – made in the United States – were shipped through COVAX. The United States has also worked in close partnership with key regional partners, including the African Union and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).<br><br>These more than 110 million doses – that are already saving lives around the world – are just the beginning of the Administration’s efforts to provide vaccines to the world. Starting at the end of this month, the Administration will begin shipping a half a billion Pfizer doses that the United States has pledged to purchase and donate to 100 low- income countries in need.<br><br><strong>Biden Administration’s Approach to Sharing U.S. Vaccines:</strong> Our goals are to increase global COVID-19 vaccination coverage, prepare for surges and prioritize healthcare workers and other vulnerable populations based on public health data and acknowledged best practice, and help our neighbors and other countries in need. Importantly, the United States has not and will not use its vaccines to secure favors from other countries. Our aim is to save lives.<br><br>The Administration looks at a variety of factors, including COVID-19 case rates, death rates, and hospitalizations; current vaccination rates; responses to surges; and a country’s ability to receive vaccines and put shots into arms.<br><br>We will continue to work with COVAX, regional partners such as the African Union and CARICOM, and other partners to ensure these vaccines are delivered in a way that is equitable and follows the science and public health data. This is a unique moment in history, and it requires American leadership, science and ingenuity, perseverance, and we are demonstrating that we can deliver results for people around the world.  <br><br><strong>To date, the U.S. has donated COVID-19 vaccines as follows:</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>7:19 P.M. EDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Tom.  Thanks for that introduction and for your generous support.  And I want to thank you all.  And, Jaime, for your support as well and being willing to take on the chairmanship. </p>



<p>You know, I didn’t have it like you did, but I remember when my dad &#8212; when things died up in Scranton; the coal dried up.&nbsp; He wasn’t a coalminer; my great grandfather was.&nbsp; But he wasn’t a coalminer, but everything else dried up.&nbsp; And he said &#8212; I remember him going home to my grandpop, who had four sons and a daughter, and asking him is it okay if his wife &#8212; my mother, Jean &#8212; and the three kids move in with him for a year or so until they got straightened away down in northern Delaware &#8212; a little town called Claymont.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so that &#8212; and he said &#8212; I’ll never forget it.&nbsp; He said, “I’ll come home every weekend, Joey.&nbsp; Every weekend.&nbsp; There’s only 147 &#8212; 157 miles.”&nbsp; And I thought, &#8220;My God, that’s a million miles.&#8221;&nbsp; I was going &#8212; I was in third grade, going into fourth.&nbsp; And you know, it’s a &#8212;</p>



<p>They used to have an expression &#8212; and that’s never &#8212; and this is the God’s truth.&nbsp; We got down to Delaware, as he worked his way through, after five years, being able to buy a small three-bedroom home.&nbsp; He used to say, “Joey, a job is a lot more than a paycheck.&nbsp; It’s about &#8212; it’s about your pride.&nbsp; It’s about your place in the community.&nbsp; It’s about your ability to look your kids in the eye.&nbsp; It’s about your dignity.”&nbsp; And so it’s much &#8212; so much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, you know, when I ran with your help &#8212; and I couldn’t have made it &#8212; with all the help of people on this line &#8212; you know &#8212; you know, we are part of something special because you allowed me to compete.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We &#8212; I think we put together one of the most consequential campaigns in modern history.&nbsp; Because it really was, in my view, a battle for the soul of the nation: basic decency, building the middle class form the bottom up and the middle out, rather than waiting for everything to trickle down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And a lot of you are very successful people on the line, but you shared that view and you gave me the money and contributions to be able to complete &#8212; you know, I say &#8212; I should say “compete.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, we’re bound together in one of the most consequential first six months in the history of this country not because of me &#8212; it’s about the country; it’s about people stepping up.</p>



<p>Think about the last six months.&nbsp; The American Rescue Plan.</p>



<p>We delivered shots in arms of millions and millions of people.&nbsp; Checks in pockets to hundreds of millions of Americans.&nbsp; And maybe the thing that I’m proudest of: We got the biggest middle-class tax cut of all time with the help of the &#8212; cutting the child poverty in half through the childcare &#8212; the Child Tax Credit.</p>



<p>And 165 million Americans are fully vaccinated.&nbsp; You got over 190 that have at least one shot &#8212; one shot.</p>



<p>It’s the fastest job growth in the first four months of any previous presidency.&nbsp; Period.</p>



<p>And a projected economic growth at nearly 7 percent &#8212; the highest in four decades.</p>



<p>And last week, they &#8212; the infrastructure plan that I introduced when I was running and put together with a bipartisan group &#8212; I had to make some compromises, but it’s going to make a gigantic difference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, it’s going to transform the economy.&nbsp; It’s over &#8212; over a trillion dollars.&nbsp; It’s going to eliminate all lead pipes in America so people have decent drinking water.&nbsp; Build roads up to &#8212; up to snuff so we build them back to, you know, making sure that they are where the environment is now &#8212; not &#8212; we have to build them back better.&nbsp; Childcare.&nbsp; The caring economy.&nbsp; The eldercare.&nbsp; The things that the American public wants most.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Man, look &#8212; and delivering high-speed Internet to every American.&nbsp; Delivering clean water, as I said, to every American.</p>



<p>Building more resilient power grids.&nbsp; Installing electric vehicle charging stations&#8211; over 500,000.&nbsp; The largest investment in public transit in rail since the creation of Amtrak 50 years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it’s all about, as my dad’s notion, it’s about creating good-paying American jobs for millions of middle-class people and the working-class people.&nbsp; And it’s about our economic competitiveness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, as a &#8212; as the Democratic Party, I think we’re going to be able to say, going into these off-year elections, as the chairman said, that we can deliver.&nbsp; We can deliver for the American people.&nbsp; We can bring the country together.&nbsp; We can make a difference in their lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you know, it’s about including everyone this time around &#8212; Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American communities &#8212; because I said the administration and our efforts would reflect what the country looked like.</p>



<p>And as I said, we’re in the race for the 21st century economy and the rest of the world is not hanging around and waiting.&nbsp; We have to move fast.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the bottom line, for me, is this: that we’re signaling &#8212; we’re signaling to the rest of the world and to ourselves that we can function, we can deliver, we can do significant things.&nbsp; And we’ve got a lot more to do as we invest in physical infrastructure, also invest in human infrastructure, childcare, paid leave, universal pre-K through two years of &#8212; and two years of community college.</p>



<p>When I hear about, “Well, you know, that&#8217;s not &#8212; that&#8217;s not investing” &#8212; well, let me tell you, when I was Vice President, I was asked to do a survey along the Secretary of Commerce of the 500 CEOs of the five &#8212; Fortune 500 to see what their greatest needs are.&nbsp; We got the 340-some.&nbsp; You know what they said, almost to a person?&nbsp; They said, “We need a better-educated public.”&nbsp; Well, they&#8217;re not educating the public.&nbsp; And so, what are we going to do?&nbsp;</p>



<p>If I said to you tomorrow, “We can maintain exorbitant tax cuts for the super wealthy” &#8212; and many of you are &#8212; “or we can make sure that every kid, starting at age three, four, and five, is in preschool, not daycare, and they have access to community college so we&#8217;re the best-educated public in the world,” which do you think is going to best promote the country&#8217;s growth? You know what it is.</p>



<p>So, look, let me close.&nbsp; I&#8217;m &#8212; I&#8217;m taking too much time.&nbsp; I want to meet each one of you.&nbsp; But, look, we need &#8212; the single-most important thing that we have to do is we have to protect the voting system, protect the sacred right to vote.&nbsp; It&#8217;s under assault in ways I haven’t seen in my entire career.&nbsp; And I was the guy who was able to get the Voting Rights exten- &#8212; Act extended 25 years before, when I was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee.&nbsp; And it wasn&#8217;t until the Supreme Court came along and said, “No, no, don&#8217;t need it anymore.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s about who gets to vote and whether the vote counts, and who gets to count that vote.&nbsp; We have a system that does both those things with independence and integrity.&nbsp; But what Republicans want to do is say a political party gets to decide if a vote counts.&nbsp; It&#8217;s outrageous.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to fight like hell so that doesn&#8217;t happen.&nbsp; That&#8217;s one of the most important things we can do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a lot of work ahead.&nbsp; It’s not going to be easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I&#8217;m going to need you to do it.&nbsp; The DNC is going to need you.&nbsp; And because &#8212; here&#8217;s the deal: We won in 2020 as a unified party.&nbsp; As we look to 2022, we need to stay unified.&nbsp; The question the American people are going to be asking is whether we&#8217;re helping them and their families, and do we understand what they&#8217;re going through; do we understand their problem; can we deliver for them.</p>



<p>You know, as Democrats, we have to show that we understand, number one; we&#8217;re delivering, number two; and we&#8217;re keeping our promise.&nbsp; We just have to keep making our case &#8212; just as the Republican party today offers nothing but fear, lies, and broken promises.&nbsp; We have to keep cutting through the Republican fog &#8211;that the government isn&#8217;t the problem, and show that we, the people &#8212; we, the people, are always the solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re the most unique country in the history of the world.&nbsp; You’ve heard me say this before.&nbsp; We&#8217;re the only country that&#8217;s organized based on an ide- &#8212; on an idea, not religion, ethnicity, geography &#8212; on an idea that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are critical equal, endowed &#8212; you know the rest.</p>



<p>But you have to be able to vote.&nbsp; It’s the single-most important thing we could do.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to have to win races up and down the ticket.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, in 2018, I was out of office, but I campaigned in 58 districts &#8212; congressional districts they said we couldn&#8217;t win.&nbsp; We won back the United States Congress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, look, if we make the right decision in the next few years, in 50 years people are going to look back and say, “This was the moment that America won the 21st century.”&nbsp; I really believe that.&nbsp; But we can&#8217;t do it without you.&nbsp; You know, we have to prove that democracies can work.</p>



<p>I’ll conclude by saying &#8212; and the press on the line has heard me say this before &#8212; that Xi Jinping, and &#8212; who I met hours and hours with &#8212; over 25 hours &#8212; 24 hours alone.&nbsp; When I won, he called me to congratulate me.&nbsp; We spent two hours and, I think, almost 25 minutes on the phone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He believes, along with other autocrats, that in the modern world, things are changing so rapidly, so quickly that democracies can&#8217;t get their acts together and unite to compete with &#8212; with autocratic governments.&nbsp; He truly believes that.&nbsp; And he&#8217;s decided that they&#8217;re going to be the most powerful military force in the world, and the largest economy and the most organized economy in the world by 2045.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve got to demonstrate that democracies can work and protect.&nbsp; And I think it&#8217;s going to impact on our influence around the world more than anything.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why we have to do some of this stuff together with others to get it done &#8212; get it done.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m convinced there&#8217;s not much we can&#8217;t do.&nbsp; I think the country is ready.&nbsp; And because of you, I think we&#8217;re going to be able to get it done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I want to thank you all.&nbsp; Thank you for everything you&#8217;ve done.&nbsp; And, you know, we got to prove we can make democracy work again.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, God bless you all for what you&#8217;ve done and going &#8212; going to do.&nbsp; And may God protect our troops.</p>

<p>On July 28, the President and the bipartisan group announced agreement on the details of a once-in-a-generation investment in our infrastructure, which was immediately taken up in the Senate for consideration. The legislation includes around $550 billion in new federal investment in America’s roads and bridges, water infrastructure, resilience, internet, and more. The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will grow the economy, enhance our competitiveness, create good jobs, and make our economy more sustainable, resilient, and just.</p>



<p>The legislation will create good-paying, union jobs. With the President’s Build Back Better Agenda, these investments will add, on average, around 2 million jobs&nbsp;per year&nbsp;over the course of the decade, while accelerating America’s path to full employment and increasing labor force participation.</p>



<p>President Biden believes that we must invest in our country and in our people by creating good-paying union jobs, tackling the climate crisis, and growing the economy sustainably and equitably for decades to come. The bipartisan legislation will deliver progress towards those objectives for working families across the country. The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act:</p>



<ul><li>Makes the largest federal investment in public transit ever</li><li>Makes the largest federal investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak</li><li>Makes the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system</li><li>Makes the largest investment in clean drinking water and waste water infrastructure in American history, delivering clean water to millions of families</li><li>Ensures every American has access to reliable high-speed internet</li><li>Helps us tackle the climate crisis by making the largest investment in clean energy transmission and EV infrastructure in history; electrifying thousands of school and transit buses across the country; and creating a new Grid Deployment Authority to build a resilient, clean, 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century electric grid</li></ul>



<p>The President promised to work across the aisle to deliver results for working families. He believes demonstrating that democracies can deliver is a critical challenge for his presidency. Today’s agreement shows that we can come together to position American workers, farmers, and businesses to compete and win in the 21st century.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Roads, Bridges, and Major Projects<br></strong></span><br>One in five miles, or 173,000 total miles, of our highways and major roads and 45,000 bridges are in poor condition. Bridges in poor condition pose heightened challenges in rural communities, which often may rely on a single bridge for the passage of emergency service vehicles. The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will invest $110 billion of new funds for roads, bridges, and major projects, and reauthorize the surface transportation program for the next five years building on bipartisan surface transportation reauthorization bills passed out of committee earlier this year. This investment will repair and rebuild our roads and bridges with a focus on climate change mitigation, resilience, equity, and safety for all users, including cyclists and pedestrians. The bill includes a total of $40 billion of new funding for bridge repair, replacement, and rehabilitation, which&nbsp;is the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. The bill also includes around $16 billion for major projects that are too large or complex for traditional funding programs but will deliver significant economic benefits to communities.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Safety</strong></span><br><br>America has one of the highest road fatality rates in the industrialized world. The legislation invests $11 billion in transportation safety programs, including a new, $5 billion Safe Streets for All program to help states and localities reduce crashes and fatalities in their communities, especially for cyclists and pedestrians.&nbsp;It includes a new program to provide grants to community owned utilities to replace leaky and obsolete cast iron and bare steel natural gas pipelines, some of which are over 100 years old. It will more than double funding directed to programs that improve the safety of people and vehicles in our transportation system, including highway safety, truck safety, and pipeline and hazardous materials safety.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Public Transit<br></span></strong><br>America’s transit infrastructure is inadequate – with a multibillion-dollar repair backlog, representing more than 24,000 buses, 5,000 rail cars, 200 stations, and thousands of miles of track, signals, and power systems in need of replacement. The legislation includes $39 billion of new investment to modernize transit, and improve accessibility for the elderly and people with disabilities. That is in addition to continuing the existing transit programs for five years as part of surface transportation reauthorization. In total, the new investments and reauthorization provide $89.9 billion in guaranteed funding for public transit over the next five years. This is the largest Federal investment in public transit in history, and devotes a larger share of funds from surface transportation reauthorization to transit in the history of the programs. It will repair and upgrade aging infrastructure, modernize bus and rail fleets, make stations accessible to all users through a new program with $1.75 billion in dedicated funding, and bring transit service to new communities with an additional $8 billion for Capital Investment Grants.&nbsp;It will replace thousands of transit vehicles, including buses, with clean, zero emission vehicles through an additional $5.75 billion, of which 5 percent is dedicated to training the transit workforce to maintain and operate these vehicles. And, it will benefit communities of color since these households are twice as likely to take public transportation and many of these communities lack sufficient public transit options.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Passenger and Freight Rail<br></span></strong><br>Unlike highways and transit, rail lacks a multi-year funding stream to address deferred maintenance, enhance existing corridors, and build new lines in high-potential locations. The legislation positions Amtrak and rail to play a central role in our transportation and economic future.&nbsp;This is the largest investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak 50 years ago.&nbsp;The legislation invests $66 billion in rail to eliminate the Amtrak maintenance backlog, modernize the Northeast Corridor, and bring world-class rail service to areas outside the northeast and mid-Atlantic. Within these totals, $22 billion would be provided as grants to Amtrak, $24 billion as federal-state partnership grants for Northeast Corridor modernization, $12 billion for partnership grants for intercity rail service, including high-speed rail, $5 billion for rail improvement and safety grants, and $3 billion for grade crossing safety improvements.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">EV Infrastructure<br></span></strong><br>U.S. market share of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) sales is only one-third the size of the Chinese EV market. The President believes that must change. The bill invests $7.5 billion to build out the first-ever national network of EV chargers in the United States and is a critical element in the Biden-Harris Administration’s plan to accelerate the adoption of EVs to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs.&nbsp;The bill will provide funding for deployment of EV chargers along highway corridors to facilitate long-distance travel and within communities to provide convenient charging where people live, work, and shop. Federal funding will have a particular focus on rural, disadvantaged, and hard-to-reach communities.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Electric Buses</span></strong><br><br>American school buses play a critical role in expanding access to education, but they are also a significant source of pollution.&nbsp;The legislation will deliver thousands of electric school buses nationwide, including in rural communities, helping school districts across the country buy clean, American-made, zero emission buses, and replace the yellow school bus fleet for America’s children.&nbsp;The legislation also invests $5 billion in zero emission and clean buses and $2.5 billion for ferries. These investments will drive demand for American-made batteries and vehicles, creating jobs and supporting domestic manufacturing, while also removing diesel buses from some of our most vulnerable communities. In addition, they will help the more than 25 million children and thousands of bus drivers who breathe polluted air on their rides to and from school. Diesel air pollution is linked to asthma and other health problems that hurt our communities and cause students to miss school, particularly in communities of color and Tribal communities.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Reconnecting Communities</span></strong><br><br>Too often, past transportation investments divided communities – like the Claiborne Expressway in New Orleans or I-81 in Syracuse – or it left out the people most in need of affordable transportation options. In particular, significant portions of the interstate highway system were built through Black neighborhoods.&nbsp;The legislation creates a first-ever program to reconnect communities divided by transportation infrastructure. The program will fund planning, design, demolition, and reconstruction of street grids, parks, or other infrastructure through $1 billion of dedicated funding in addition to historic levels of major projects funding, for which these investments could also qualify.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Airports, Ports, and Waterways<br></span></strong><br>The United States built modern aviation, but our airports lag far behind our competitors. According to some rankings, no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide. Our ports and waterways need repair and reimagination too.&nbsp;The bill invests $17 billion in port infrastructure and $25 billion in airports to address repair and maintenance backlogs, reduce congestion and emissions near ports and airports, and drive electrification and other low-carbon technologies. Modern, resilient, and sustainable port, airport, and freight infrastructure will support U.S. competitiveness by removing bottlenecks and expediting commerce and reduce the environmental impact on neighboring communities.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Resilience and Western Water Infrastructure<br></span></strong><br>Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change each year when their roads wash out, airport power goes down, or schools get flooded. Last year alone, the United States faced 22 extreme weather and climate-related disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each – a cumulative price tag of nearly $100 billion. People of color are more likely to live in areas most vulnerable to flooding and other climate change-related weather events.&nbsp;The legislation makes our communities safer and our infrastructure more resilient to the impacts of climate change and cyber-attacks, with an investment of over $50 billion.&nbsp;This includes funds to protect against droughts, floods and wildfires, in addition to a major investment in weatherization. The bill is the largest investment in the resilience of physical and natural systems in American history.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Clean Drinking Water<br></span></strong><br>Currently, up to 10 million American households and 400,000 schools and child care centers lack safe drinking water.&nbsp;The legislation’s $55 billion investment represents the largest investment in clean drinking water in American history, including dedicated funding to replace lead service lines and the dangerous chemical PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl).&nbsp;It will replace all of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines. From rural towns to struggling cities, the legislation invests in water infrastructure across America, including in Tribal Nations and disadvantaged communities that need it most.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">High-Speed Internet<br></span></strong><br>Broadband internet is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, to participate equally in school learning, health care, and to stay connected. Yet, by one definition, more than 30 million Americans live in areas where there is no broadband infrastructure that provides minimally acceptable speeds – a particular problem in rural communities throughout the country. The legislation’s $65 billion investment – which builds on the billions of dollars provided for broadband deployment in the American Rescue Plan – will help ensure every American has access to reliable high-speed internet with an historic investment in broadband infrastructure deployment, just as the federal government made a historic effort to provide electricity to every American nearly one hundred years ago.<br><br>The bill will also help lower prices for internet service by requiring funding recipients to offer a low-cost affordable plan, by requiring providers to display a “Broadband Nutrition Label” that will help families comparison shop for a better deal, and by boosting competition in areas where existing providers aren’t providing adequate service. It will also help close the digital divide by passing the Digital Equity Act (which creates new grant programs for digital inclusion), by requiring the Federal Communications Commission to adopt rules banning digital redlining, and by creating a new, permanent program to help more low-income households access the internet. Over one in four households will be eligible for this new Affordable Connectivity Benefit.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Environmental Remediation</span></strong><br><br>In thousands of rural and urban communities around the country, hundreds of thousands of former industrial and energy sites are now idle – sources of blight and pollution. 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall. Proximity to a Superfund site can lead to elevated levels of lead in children’s blood.&nbsp;The legislation invests $21 billion in environmental remediation, making the largest investment in addressing the legacy pollution that harms the public health of communities and neighborhoods in American history, creating good-paying union jobs in hard-hit energy communities and advancing economic and environmental justice.&nbsp;The bill includes funds to clean up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaim abandoned mine land and cap orphaned gas wells.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Power Infrastructure</span></strong><br><br>As the recent Texas power outages demonstrated, our aging electric grid needs urgent modernization. A Department of Energy study found that power outages cost the U.S. economy up to $70 billion annually.&nbsp;The legislation’s roughly $65 billion investment includes the single largest investment in clean energy transmission in American history. It upgrades our power infrastructure, including by building thousands of miles of new, resilient transmission lines to facilitate the expansion of renewable energy. It creates a new Grid Deployment Authority, invests in research and development for advanced transmission and electricity distribution technologies, and promotes smart grid technologies that deliver flexibility and resilience. It invests in demonstration projects and research hubs for next generation technologies like advanced nuclear, carbon capture, and clean hydrogen.</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Offsets</span></strong><br><br>In the years ahead, the legislation will generate significant economic benefits. It is financed through a combination of redirecting unspent emergency relief funds, targeted corporate user fees, strengthening tax enforcement when it comes to crypto currencies, and other bipartisan measures, in addition to the revenue generated from higher economic growth as a result of the investments.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference </p>



<p>4:18 P.M. EDT<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; And thanks for joining us.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll turn to Dr. Walensky and Dr. Fauci in a moment.&nbsp; First, I want to provide an update on our whole-of-government response to the pandemic.&nbsp;<br><br>We remain concerned about the continued rise in cases driven by the Delta variant.&nbsp; These cases are concentrated in communities with lower vaccination rates.&nbsp; In fact, the seven states with the lowest vaccination rates represent just about 8.5 percent of the U.S. population but account for more than 17 percent of cases.&nbsp; And one in three cases nationwide occurred in Florida and Texas this past week.&nbsp;<br><br>From the start, we&#8217;ve known that this virus is unpredictable.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we spent the last six months preparing for every scenario.&nbsp; As a result, we have the tools we need to manage this most &#8212; this.&nbsp; Most importantly &#8212; the tool that is most important is the highly effective vaccines.&nbsp; We have enough vaccines for every American who wants one.&nbsp; They&#8217;re free and they&#8217;re easily accessible &#8212; within five miles of where 90 percent of where Americans live.&nbsp;<br><br>And in just six months, we&#8217;ve already gotten 165 million Americans fully vaccinated &#8212; including 80 percent of seniors, who are the most vulnerable.<br><br>But we have much more work to do to put this pandemic behind us.&nbsp; There are still about 90 million eligible Americans who are unvaccinated.&nbsp; And we need them to do their part, roll up their sleeves, and get vaccinated.&nbsp; Each and every shot matters.&nbsp;<br><br>And last week, the President laid out several areas where we&#8217;re taking additional steps to get more Americans vaccinated.&nbsp; We expanded the tax credit to help small- and medium-sized businesses provide their employees paid time off to get themselves and also their families vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>And we&#8217;re working with school districts and pharmacies to bring vaccines to schools to make it as convenient as possible for students to get vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>In the past two weeks, we&#8217;ve seen a 50 percent increase in the average number of 12- to 17-year-olds getting vaccinated each day.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a very encouraging uptick.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re also working with states to encourage vaccinations through incentives, which have made a difference throughout the vaccination effort.&nbsp; Last week, the President called on states and local governments to use funding they have received, including from the American Rescue Plan, to give $100 to anyone who gets fully vaccinated.&nbsp; Minnesota and New Mexico have already stepped up to answer the President&#8217;s call.&nbsp;<br><br>If financial incentives like these help us get more shots in arms, we should use them.&nbsp; But in addition to incentives, it&#8217;s time to impose some requirements based on the realities of different risks unvaccinated individuals pose versus those who have been vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>Last week, the Department of Veteran Affairs announced it will require doctors and nurses and other healthcare workers who provide medical care to our veterans to get vaccinated.&nbsp; This is in lockstep with many healthcare employers around the country who are requiring vaccinations and will protect our veterans when they get medical care.<br><br>At the President&#8217;s direction, the Department of Defense is looking into how and when they will add the COVID-19 vaccination to the list of required vaccinations for the military.<br><br>And to protect the federal workforce, their loved ones, and their communities, the President announced that every federal government employee will be asked to attest to their vaccination status.&nbsp; Any federal employee who does not attest or is not vaccinated will be required to mask, no matter where they work; get tested once or twice a week; socially distance; and, generally, will not be allowed to travel for work.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;re taking steps to apply similar standards to all federal contractors.&nbsp; It&#8217;s simple: If you want to do business with the federal government, get your workers vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>And the President has called on all employers around the country to protect their own workforces.&nbsp; And now we&#8217;re seeing positive momentum across the private sector.&nbsp; The Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Business Roundtable have all applauded the actions we&#8217;re taking.&nbsp; Companies like Google, Walmart, and Disney have announced vaccination requirements for their employees, joining hundreds of universities and hospital systems across the country who are implementing similar requirements.&nbsp;<br><br>With these ongoing efforts, there&#8217;s a strong sense of progress.&nbsp; And you see it in the number of shots we&#8217;re getting into people&#8217;s arms each day.&nbsp;<br><br>Over the past few weeks, we&#8217;ve seen a nearly 70 percent increase in the average number of new people getting vaccinated each and every day.&nbsp; In the last seven days alone, 3 million Americans have gotten their first shot.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the highest seven-day totals since July 4th.<br><br>And just today, we hit 70 percent of adults with at least one shot, including 90 percent of seniors with at least one shot.&nbsp; These are significant milestones in our fight against the virus.&nbsp;<br><br>And it&#8217;s very important to note, in the states with the highest case rates, daily vaccination rates have more than doubled.&nbsp; The eight states with highest current case rates have seen an average increase of 171 percent in the number of people newly vaccinated each day over the past three weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Louisiana has seen a 302 percent increase in the average number of newly vaccinated per day; Mississippi, 250 percent;&nbsp;Alabama, 215 percent; and Arkansas, 206 percent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This increase in vaccination rates in states that have been lagging is a positive trend.&nbsp; Americans are seeing the risk and impact of being unvaccinated and responding with action.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s going to take to get us out of this pandemic.</p>



<p>With that, let me turn it over to Dr. Walensky and Dr. Fauci.&nbsp; Dr. Walensky first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s begin with an overview of the data.&nbsp; As of Saturday, CDC reported the seven-day moving average of daily new COVID-19 cases to be about 72,000 cases per day.&nbsp; This represents an increase of 44 percent from the prior seven-day average and higher than our peak of last summer.</p>



<p>The seven-day average of hospital admissions is about 6,200 per day, an increase of about 41 percent from the prior seven-day period.&nbsp; And seven-day average daily deaths have also increased to 300 per day &#8212; an increase of more than 25 percent from the previous seven-day period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I want to start today by simply stating the obvious.&nbsp; While we desperately want to be done with this pandemic, COVID-19 is clearly not done with us, and so our battle must last a little longer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of us have lost loved ones or have been ill ourselves.&nbsp; All of us have given up things in our lives that we enjoy.&nbsp; This is hard, this is heavy, but we are in this together.&nbsp; And as we learn more about COVID, we continue to rely on proven ways to protect ourselves, our children, and our loved ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I told you I would give you scientific information as I have it, when I have it.&nbsp; Here is what we have learned in the last two weeks about the Delta variant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, the Delta variant is highly contagious. &nbsp;To put this in perspective, if you get sick with the Alpha variant, you could infect about two other unvaccinated people.&nbsp; If you get sick with the Delta variant, we estimate that you could infect about five other unvaccinated people &#8212; more than twice as many as the original strain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, infections with the Delta variant result in higher viral loads.&nbsp; This means that those who are infected have a larger burden of virus that they can spread to others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Third, those higher viral loads are seen not just in those who are unvaccinated and infected but also, and importantly, in the small proportion of those who are vaccinated and become infected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last week, we published data on an outbreak in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, where there were 346 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in people who were fully vaccinated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the summer, some towns in Barnstable County can have up to 240,000 visitors per month.&nbsp; Those with breakthrough infections had viral loads that were similar to people who were infected and unvaccinated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This new finding, combined with data from other outbreak investigations and surveillance studies across the country, was critical in our decision to update our guidance for those who are fully vaccinated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since those data were released, several other studies have been released over just this past weekend that have corroborated these findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taken together, the Delta variant is different from prior strains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I understand this is all frustrating news, and I share this frustration.&nbsp; We continue to learn each day from emerging science and use this evidence to update our recommendations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because of what we now know about the Delta variant and infections in those who are vaccinated, we updated our recommendations, including recommending masks in public, indoor settings in areas with substantial and high transmission, shown in orange and red on this map.&nbsp; It is also the reason we continue to recommend universal indoor masking in K-through-12 schools throughout the country so our children can safely get back to school and safely stay there.</p>



<p>In all of this, there is still good news.&nbsp; Our vaccines are working to prevent severe illness, hospitalizations, and death.&nbsp; Vaccines are providing protection both for individuals and communities across the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As I have said before, this remains a pandemic of the unvaccinated, where the vast majority of spread is &#8212; in this country is among those who are unvaccinated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I want to be clear: While vaccinated people can spread the virus if they get a breakthrough infection, the odds of them getting sick in the first place are far lower than those who are unvaccinated.&nbsp; And in fact, places with more vaccination generally have less disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can see this on a population level on this slide, where we compare case counts and vaccination coverage by state, with vaccination coverage on the horizontal axis and case counts on the vertical axis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>States with the highest vaccination coverage are the dots furthest to the right on the graph, and states with the highest case counts are the dots closest to the top.&nbsp; Notice that the states that have lower vaccination coverage &#8212; those further to the left &#8212; have higher rates of community transmission, as shown in red and orange.&nbsp; States that have higher vaccination coverage &#8212; further to the right &#8212; have lower rates of cases, as shown in yellow.</p>



<p>There is any direct correlation with vaccine coverage and case rates.&nbsp; And I think it&#8217;s worth reiterating that public health prevention strategies, including masks, continue to work while you&#8217;re unvaccinated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the following outbreaks of cases in Barnstable County and in subsequent public health follow-up, we saw the power of vaccines and masks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the month of July, there were a total of 934 confirmed cases of COVID-19 linked to the outbreak in Barnstable County.&nbsp; With 73 percent of these infections in people who were vaccinated, there were only seven hospitalizations and no deaths.<br><br>Our vaccines did exactly what they were supposed to do: prevent severe disease, hospitalization, and death.<br><br>Furthermore, as cases increased, local public health officials implemented a package of public health prevention strategies, including increased testing, contact tracing, and indoor mask wearing.&nbsp; And within two weeks, test positivity fell from a peak of 15.1 percent to 4.6 percent.&nbsp; Public health prevention strategies work.<br><br>Let me end by reiterating three things you need to know. First, our vaccines are working to prevent severe illness, hospitalization, and death.&nbsp; And if you are not vaccinated, please protect yourself and get vaccinated.<br><br>Second, masks will protect you and your family.&nbsp; If you are in an area of substantial or high transmission, please wear a mask in public indoor settings, regardless of your vaccination status.<br><br>And third, we need to keep our children safe and in school. Get everyone in your family over the age of 12 vaccinated and please wear masks in school.<br><br>Finally, we stand here with you, providing science and updated guidance in real time, to keep you and your families safe.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll now turn it over to Dr. Fauci.<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Thank you very much, Dr. Walensky.&nbsp; I&#8217;d like to take up on the theme that Dr. Walensky started with.<br><br>If I could have the first slide.<br><br>I&#8217;m going to be spending a couple of minutes addressing two issues that are very much on the attention of people throughout the country and the world.<br><br>The first is, as Dr. Walensky mentioned, the real-world effectiveness of vaccines in the context of the Delta variant, and, second, breakthrough infections, what they mean.&nbsp; And let&#8217;s discuss them a bit.<br><br>Next slide.<br><br>Let&#8217;s look at the real-world effectiveness against the Delta variant.&nbsp; If you look at the three components of PCR-confirmed infection, it&#8217;s 79 percent in a UK study.&nbsp; Symptomatic infection is 88 percent.<br><br>And just as Dr. Walensky mentioned, the vaccines are doing exactly what we&#8217;re asking them to do when it comes to keeping you out of the hospital, out of serious disease, and certainly preventing your death.<br><br>Just a quick comment on the 79 percent:&nbsp;That may look a bit low, but remember, the efficacy of the clinical trials that were published by the trials that gave you something like 94 or 95 percent was against clinically apparent disease.&nbsp; What we&#8217;re talking about here is just infection, so you would expect it to be a bit lower.&nbsp; This has important implications when you get into the discussion of what we call &#8220;breakthrough infections.&#8221;<br><br>Next slide.<br><br>Now, if you take these data and look at them across multiple countries but ask the question, “What does a full component of a Pfizer mRNA provide with regard to protection against Alpha versus Delta in three separate countries?” &#8212; the data on the left are essentially the data I just showed you; Alpha now is in blue and Delta is in red.&nbsp;<br><br>When you get to Canada, you see a similar protection against hospitalization, which is the area a bit to the right in that middle panel, compared to symptomatic disease.&nbsp; When you get to Israel, you see what we now know from reports from Israel: that you see a diminution at around 64 percent for confirmed and symptomatic disease.&nbsp; This is likely due to the fact that Israel has started their vaccination program before the other countries, so you&#8217;re seeing a little bit down the pipe from the beginning.&nbsp; But note, again, the 93 percent consistently showing protection against advanced disease.<br><br>Next slide.<br><br>Now if you ask the question, “What about the reduced risk of either symptomatic infection, hospitalization, or death when you compare vaccinated individuals with unvaccinated people, what is the fold reduction when you&#8217;re in red, with unvaccinated, versus in blue, with full vaccinated?”&nbsp; As you can see for disease itself, it&#8217;s an eight-fold reduction.&nbsp; For hospitalization, 25-fold reduction.&nbsp; And for death, 25-fold reduction.<br><br>Let&#8217;s move on now to breakthrough infections.&nbsp; Just a couple of comments.&nbsp;<br><br>We can pass this slide.&nbsp; Go to the next slide, please.<br><br>The breakthrough infections: We have &#8212; no vaccine is 100 percent effective, and so you can expect breakthrough infections.&nbsp; So, even with a high vaccine effectiveness, most of these infections are going to be asymptomatic or mild.&nbsp; And we know that.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve already seen that from the experience in Massachusetts, in Provincetown, and we see it in all other situations.<br><br>An important point to bring up is that the greater percentage of people that are vaccinated, even with a high degree of protection, the absolute number of breakthrough infections might appear high.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not the critical number. The critical number is what is the proportion of the vaccinated people who, in fact, are getting breakthrough infections.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s the critical one.&nbsp;<br><br>The bottom line of what we are saying is that &#8212; next slide &#8212; get vaccinated.&nbsp; I say that every single time.&nbsp; We all say it.&nbsp; The COVID vaccines give strong protection against the Delta variant, and it protects you, your family, and your community.<br><br>Back to you, Jeff.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Thank you, Dr. Fauci, and thank you, Dr. Walensky.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>As you both stated, it&#8217;s never been more important to get vaccinated.&nbsp; That&#8217;s how we stop the spread of the Delta variant.&nbsp; And each and every shot matters.<br><br>And while we work to get more people vaccinated, the federal government is also helping states and communities respond to outbreaks.&nbsp;<br><br>Since launching our COVID-19 surge teams, we&#8217;ve been working directly with 10 states to support their efforts to combat rising cases with federal assistance and support.<br><br>Last week, we reiterated to all governors that we stand ready to help them in meeting this moment, whether that be through more testing, increasing treatments, vaccine access and uptake, or other state-specific needs.<br><br>For example, in Missouri, CDC experts are on the ground providing epidemiology, data analysis, and other public health support.&nbsp; FEMA in Missouri is helping to expand ambulance capacity, and HHS and FEMA are helping the state address their hospital needs.<br><br>We&#8217;re working with states like North Carolina on mobile vaccination clinics.&nbsp; In Tennessee, on public health staffing. And the administration is doing extensive outreach in states like Wyoming and Arizona to encourage more physicians to use lifesaving monoclonal antibody treatments &#8212; antibody treatments.&nbsp; Those are really effective, and we need to deploy them more and more where they&#8217;re needed.<br><br>The bottom line is, we&#8217;re doing everything we can to help more Americans get vaccinated and to help states fight the spread in their communities.<br><br>With that, let&#8217;s take a few questions.<br><br>First question.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; And a reminder &#8212;<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Could I please interject something?&nbsp; Jeff, I want to just add one thing.&nbsp; One of the slides was deleted &#8212; a technical difficulty that I&#8217;d just like to spend maybe 15 seconds.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Please.<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s really important.&nbsp; When we talk &#8212; it was mistakenly deleted, and that&#8217;s the reason why I skipped by that other slide.&nbsp;<br><br>When you look at breakthrough infections, as I mentioned, they&#8217;re expected and usually asymptomatic.&nbsp;<br><br>As of July 26th, the CDC received 6,587 reports of breakthrough infections that resulted in hospitalization or death among 163 &#8212; fully vaccinated &#8212; million people.&nbsp; That is a percentage of 0.01 percent or less.<br><br>And when you look at the breakthrough cases, the percent of breakthrough cases in multiple locations, like D.C. and Virginia, the percent ranges from 0.26 to 0.03.&nbsp;<br><br>So, I&#8217;m sorry that was left out.&nbsp; The bottom line is they are rare, and they rarely result &#8212; not rarely, but unusually result in hospitalization or death.<br><br>Thanks, Jeff.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Thank you, Dr. Fauci.&nbsp;<br><br>Okay, first question, please.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Please keep your question to one question.&nbsp; We&#8217;re very limited on time.<br><br>Jeff Mason, Reuters.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks very much.&nbsp; Jeff, you said earlier that it was time to do &#8212; to have requirements with relation to the vaccine, and then you went on to list basically what you said last week about the VA and the &#8212; and DOD.&nbsp; Are there more requirements coming?&nbsp; Do you think that there should be more requirements coming?&nbsp; And can you respond broadly to the impression that you are playing down the breakthrough cases?&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;ll take the &#8212; the first part of the question, and then I&#8217;ll turn it to Dr. Fauci because he just talked about breakthrough cases.<br><br>Jeff, as you know, in the federal government, we&#8217;ve now put forward a strong system that if you&#8217;re vaccinated, you can come back to work as normal.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re not vaccinated, there are quite strict rules that you need to follow around testing, social distancing, and masking.<br><br>The Department of Veterans Affairs, as you said, is an example of a vaccine requirement for all of their caregivers to our veterans.&nbsp; The President has asked the Department of Defense to look into how they will add COVID to the list of mandatory vaccinations for our armed forces &#8212; how and when they would do that.&nbsp; We will be looking, across the federal government, in other areas that could require these types of req- &#8212; mandates, if you will, for vaccination.<br><br>At the same time, I think it&#8217;s really encouraging that we&#8217;re seeing the private sector follow.&nbsp; I mentioned Walmart, Disney, and Google all announcing vaccine requirements, and there&#8217;s dozens of other companies that are doing these types of actions to protect their workers as they come back to work &#8212; universities, other health systems.<br><br>So, Jeff, I think you&#8217;re going to see a continued increase in vaccination requirements as people bring employees back to work.&nbsp;<br><br>Second question was around breakthroughs.&nbsp; Dr. Fauci.<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry, what was the exact question about breakthrough, Jeff?&nbsp; I missed that.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; This is Jeff Zients.&nbsp; Jeff Mason was asking: Are we downplaying, in some way, the number of breakthrough infections that are happening across the country?<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; No, no, we&#8217;re actually not, Jeff &#8212; Jeff Mason, that is.&nbsp; (Laughs.) &nbsp;I &#8212; as I mentioned in the discussion, when you look at the numbers &#8212; the total absolute numbers when you&#8217;re dealing with a cohort that you&#8217;re examining, that is a very high percentage of people who are vaccinated or large numbers &#8212; by definition, even with a high degree of efficacy, you&#8217;re going to see absolute numbers that are high.&nbsp;<br><br>The critical issue is: What is the relative number &#8212; the percent that I mentioned?&nbsp; And that&#8217;s the reason why &#8212; I apologize &#8212; I wanted to interject that slide that was left out: to show you the lower percentage of people who are in that category.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Next question, please.<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Is Sheryl Stolberg, New York Times.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks for doing this call.&nbsp; A lot of Americans remain very confused about the recommendations.&nbsp; They don&#8217;t understand why vaccinated people need to start wearing masks again.&nbsp; They&#8217;re confused about what this means for their children in schools.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m wondering if you think your messaging has been clear enough to the public.&nbsp; And what, if anything, are you going to do to try to address the confusion and maybe simplify things for ordinary Americans out there who don&#8217;t follow every nuance of the science?<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp;Walensky?&nbsp;<br><br>DR. WALENSKY: Yeah, thank you, Sheryl.&nbsp; So maybe I&#8217;ll start with the children and say I think our guidance is very clear about where we should be in schools.&nbsp; And that is: Everyone who is in a K-through-12 school in the fall should be masked.&nbsp; Everyone across the country &#8212; adults, children, vaccinated, or unvaccinated &#8212; everyone should be masked.<br>In terms of the question about guidance for vaccinated people wearing masks, there are two components to what we&#8217;re trying to do here.&nbsp; One, is, we&#8217;re trying to save lives with our vaccines.&nbsp; And they’re working to do so, and that’s terrific.&nbsp; What they weren&#8217;t studied in the clinical trials is to whether they prevent transmission.&nbsp; Initially, they did with Alpha.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they no longer do with Delta.<br><br>The good news is that the vaccines really do work to prevent getting sick.&nbsp; However, for those people who do get sick, we are suggesting &#8212; the data suggests that you could potentially transmit.&nbsp; And for that reason, we are suggesting both vaccinated and unvaccinated, in areas of high disease burden &#8212; orange or red on the map &#8212; continue to wear masks so they don&#8217;t bring the disease home or to others who are unvaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; I would just add that, from day one, the President said we would lead with science and facts, and that continues to be the approach at CDC.&nbsp; And our other health experts are doing just that: leading with science and facts.<br><br>We never said that this was going to be easy, but the best thing we can do right now is listen to the science and get more people vaccinated and follow the CDC public health recommendations.<br><br>Next question.<br><br>OPERATOR:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go to Erin Billups at Spectrum.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, thanks so much for taking my question.&nbsp; I was wondering how much of any surveillance is being done to determine the amount of asymptomatic spread?&nbsp; Experts I&#8217;ve spoken to say not enough of this is happening.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, to help people get a sense of how much protection previous COVID infections offer &#8212; that&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve heard a lot of people point to as a reason they don&#8217;t need to be vaccinated.&nbsp; Is there any data on the number of people infected with Delta who had previous COVID infections, and whether that offered them any protection?<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Dr. Walensky, first.&nbsp; And then, Dr. Fauci.<br><br>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; So, we have numerous cohort studies that are examining exactly that.&nbsp; So we have several cohorts &#8212; tens of thousands of people across the country &#8212; where some of them are actually doing weekly PCR testing.&nbsp; These are cohorts of essential workers and healthcare workers.&nbsp; So we can actually examine how much disease is occurring in people who might be asymptomatic.&nbsp; That is the best epidemiologic way to study exactly that question.<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; The &#8212;<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr. Fauci.&nbsp;<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; With regard to the second question that if you&#8217;re dealing with the same variant, if you get infected with an Alpha variant or another variant, and that you recover from that, you are pretty well protected for a reasonable period of time from reinfection.&nbsp; It isn&#8217;t perfect, but it&#8217;s &#8212; it&#8217;s good protection.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t doubt that.<br><br>The situation changes when you&#8217;re dealing with the evolution of a new variant, such as the Delta variant.&nbsp; And what we are seeing right now that there are reinfections.&nbsp; The protection you get from the original infection still exists somewhat, but reinfections occur at a much greater rate among individuals now than we did against the original Alpha.<br><br>So, bottom line is: When you&#8217;re dealing with a variant, you don&#8217;t get the kind of protection that you would have hoped to have gotten from a previous infection.<br><br>Regarding the issue of vaccinating people: There&#8217;s no doubt when you vaccinate someone who has had an original infection and who has recovered, not only do you increase the depth of the protection, not only do you increase the duration, but you also increase the breadth of it so that you cover not only the original, but the variants.&nbsp;<br><br>And that&#8217;s the reason why the recommendation still holds that even though you&#8217;ve been infected previously, in the context of variants, it&#8217;s a good idea to get vaccinated anyway.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Next question.&nbsp;<br><br>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Go to Rachel Cohrs at STAT news.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi there.&nbsp; I had a question for Director Walensky about, you know, whether the CDC is tracking COVID-19 booster shots that may be authorized by physicians.&nbsp;<br><br>DR. WALENSKY:&nbsp; We are just &#8212; thank you for that question, Rachel &#8212; we are just starting to gather data and get data on &#8212; and we can discern between people who have gotten second and third shots.&nbsp; We are trying hard to encourage people to report on the safety side if people have taken the initiative to get their third shot &#8212; again, not yet recommended &#8212; but we have the capacity and are looking at those data right now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Dr. Fauci, anything to add there?<br><br>DR. FAUCI:&nbsp; No, nothing to add.&nbsp; She said it very well.<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Next question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MODERATOR:&nbsp; Alright.&nbsp; We got to do last question.&nbsp; Let’s go to Zeke with AP.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you all for doing this.&nbsp; I’m just following up on Jeff Mason’s question earlier for you, Jeff Zients, on the additional requirements.&nbsp; It seems what you&#8217;re trying to do here is impose some sort of cost on people who are unvaccinated as a stick there and sort of get them to roll up their sleeve and get the shot.&nbsp; So why isn’t the federal government going further on some of these &#8212; you know, whether it be mandating vaccination requirements for travel &#8212; across the federal workforce, for instance.&nbsp; You know, how far is the administration willing to go to sort of, you know, turn up the pressure on the unvaccinated to actually get shots?<br><br>MR. ZIENTS:&nbsp; Well, Zeke, I think we&#8217;ve taken significant steps here to make it difficult to come back to work, or more difficult to come back to work, if you&#8217;re not vaccinated.&nbsp; There&#8217;s so many reasons to get vaccinated that we&#8217;ve talked about &#8212; to protect yourself and to protect your loved ones.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s also a really straightforward way to return to work.&nbsp;<br><br>So for all federal employees, the path back to work if you&#8217;re vaccinated is straightforward.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re not vaccinated or you&#8217;re not willing to attest to being vaccinated, then you &#8212; we’re doing the right thing to protect the workforce, to protect the individual, their family, and their colleagues, which is rigorous testing, social distancing, and masking.&nbsp;<br><br>There are mandates at the VA for vaccination for their healthcare workers &#8212; their doctors and their nurses and other healthcare providers who take care of our veterans.&nbsp; That&#8217;s consistent with a lot of health systems across the country and a growing number of health systems that are requiring vaccination for their healthcare workers who are on the frontlines.&nbsp;<br><br>As I said earlier, the Department of Defense is looking into how and when they&#8217;ll add COVID to the list of mandatory vaccinations for active-duty military.&nbsp;<br><br>At the same time, we will continue to look across the federal government at other areas where requirement- &#8212; requiring vaccines, everyone be vaccinated may make sense, particularly in the healthcare setting.&nbsp;<br><br>And we&#8217;re seeing it in the private sector.&nbsp; More and more companies are coming up with systems that are modeled after our system or similar to our system, or requiring vaccinations across the board.&nbsp;<br><br>You&#8217;re seeing it at universities.&nbsp; You&#8217;re seeing it in health systems.&nbsp; So I think that this requiring of individuals to be vaccinated in order to come back to work or to go back to school is a growing trend and makes a lot of sense, given that we&#8217;re going to beat this pandemic by getting more and more people vaccinated.&nbsp;<br><br>I want to thank everybody for today.&nbsp; I look forward to the next briefing.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;<br><br>4:52 P.M. EDT</p>
