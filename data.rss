<p class="has-text-align-center">Los Angeles Convention Center<br>Los Angeles, California</p>



<p>1:44 P.M. PDT</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT: &nbsp;Well, hello, everyone. &nbsp;My problem is I’m getting to like these people too much. &nbsp;(Laughter.) &nbsp;We’re going to get one another in trouble, I’m afraid.</p>



<p>Today, the leaders on this stage are joining together to make what &#8212; and is almo- &#8212; it’s an overused phrase in international relations and public life: to make a historic commitment. &nbsp;Because it is a historic commitment we’re about to make. &nbsp;Twenty countries coming together to launch the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection.</p>



<p>With this declaration, we’re transforming our approach to managing migration in the Americas. &nbsp;Each of us &#8212; each of us is signing up to commitments that recognizes the challenges we all share and the responsibility that impacts on all of our nations. &nbsp;And that &#8212; that will take all of our nations &#8212; and this is &#8212; I’ve learned by significant experience &#8212; it’s going to take all of our nations working together in partnership to address this migration issue.</p>



<p>In the past few years, the global economic crisis triggered by COVID-19 pandemic, and now made worse by Russia’s war in Ukraine and the political turmoil from auto- &#8212; from aut- &#8212; excuse me, autota- &#8212; auta- &#8212; autocracies, regimes in our region, has led to record levels of migration, not just to the United States. &nbsp;Colombia has hosted millions of refugees from Venezuela. &nbsp;Right now, migrants make up as much as 10 percent of the population of Costa Rica. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And no nation should bear this responsibility alone, in my view &#8212; our view. &nbsp;The economic futures depend on one another. &nbsp;Each of our futures depend on one another. &nbsp;And our security is linked in ways that I don’t think most people in my country fully understand, and maybe not in your countries as well. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Our common humanity demands that we care for our neighbors by working together. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The Los Angeles Declaration is built around four core pillars:&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, stability and assistance: making sure the communities that are welcoming refugees can afford to care for them, to educate them in their education, medical care, shelter, and job opportunities. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, increasing pathways for legal migration throughout the region as well as protections for refugees. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Third, working together to implement more humane and coordinated border management systems. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And finally, making sure we are working together to respond to emergencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, we know that safe, orderly, and legal migration is good for all our economies. &nbsp;But we need to halt the dangerous and unlawful ways people are migrating &#8212; and the dangerous ways. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlawful migration is not acceptable, and we’ll secure our borders, including through innovative, coordinated actions with our regional partners. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Working these efforts simultaneously, though &#8212; humane policies that secure borders and support people &#8212; representing ground-breaking, integrated new approaches. &nbsp;It addresses the needs of vulnerable migrants and the needs of countries hosting those migrants. &nbsp;That’s why it has the support of the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees and the International Organization for Migration. &nbsp;And that’s why so many nations &#8212; again, 20, representing the entire migration route from Chile to Canada &#8212; were eager to sign up to be part of this shared solution and have stepped up with their own major commitments. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I particularly want to thank President Chaves of Costa Rica and President Lasso &#8212; who you’ll hear from in a minute &#8212; of Ecuador for your new commitments to support and protect migrants in your countries so you have the chance to stay and begin to rebuild your lives where they are. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And like many others, countries and the United States are stepping up with significant commitments as well. &nbsp;To help our partners in the region continue to welcome refugees and migrants, we’re providing economic support. &nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, more than $300 million in new funding for the humanitarian assistance for countries in the region so when migrants arrive on their doorstep, they can provide a place to stay, make sure migrants can see a doctor, find opportunities to work so they don’t have to undertake the dangerous journey north.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we’re going to provide millions more, including through the World Bank, to support countries and communities that are carrying the greatest responsibility for migrants. &nbsp;For example, Colombia received $800 million last year &#8212; not enough, but $800 million, that &#8212; that will help respond to the influx of refugees from Venezuela. &nbsp;And there’s more we’ll do, working with the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re also expanding opportunities for people to come to the United States lawfully. &nbsp;In the next two years, we’ll resettle 20,000 refugees from the region. &nbsp;In addition, we recently resumed the Cuban Family Reunification Program &#8212; Parole Program. &nbsp;We’re resuming increasing access to the Haitian Family Reunification Parole Program, with a goal of admitting 20,000 per year per country. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And on this jobs front, our Department of Agriculture is launching the pilot program, funded by the American Rescue Plan, to help American farmers bring in seasonal agricultural workers from northern Central America, countries under the H-2A visa program to improve conditions for all workers. &nbsp;The program was designed in cooperation with the United Farm Workers and through the close consultation with farmers, farmworkers, unions, and other stakeholders. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re also dedicated to an additional 11,500 H-2B non-agricultural temporary work visas to open opportunities for workers from Haiti and northern &#8212; north Central American countries. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Mexico, Guatemala, Canada, and Spain are also making commitments today to expand labor pathways to their countries as well. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in addition to securing our border and bringing order to the asylum processing in the United States, the Department of Homeland Security is leading a first-of-its-kind campaign to disrupt human smuggling in the region. &nbsp;</p>



<p>If you prey on desperate and vulnerable migrants for profit, we are coming for you. &nbsp;We are coming after you. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In the first two months of our anti-smuggling campaign, the United States has worked with our partner nations to raid stash houses, impound vehicles used smuggling operation &#8212; for use for smuggling operations, and we made more than 1,800 arrests. &nbsp;And as we speak, Mexico and the United States are conducting what is known as “mirror patrols” &#8212; joint operations to interdict criminals attempting to illegally move drugs and migrants across our borders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is just a start. &nbsp;There&#8217;s &#8212; much more work remains, to state the obvious. &nbsp;Every country needs to work together to maintain a humane and orderly immigration process, to invest in securing the borders, screen and registering migrants who enter their countries, and repatriating those that do not qualify to remain. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I hope more countries will see the potential for joining the Los Angeles Declaration. &nbsp;And I want to thank all of my fellow leaders on this stage for committing to this historic new vision for our region. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And now I’d like to invite President Lasso of Ecuador to say a few words. &nbsp;And thank you all very, very much for your patience.(Applause.)&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>President Biden and Vice President Harris met yesterday with leaders of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Dominican Republic at the Ninth Summit of the Americas to develop a plan to partner in addressing the unique vulnerabilities and urgent economic challenges facing these countries, which are facing overlapping economic challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of climate change, food and energy insecurity, and lack of access to financing. Seized with these challenges,&nbsp;President Biden and Vice President Harris committed to working with CARICOM and the Dominican Republic to form three high-level committees tasked with developing immediate and concrete, joint, and near-term solutions.<br><br>Building on Vice President Harris’ April 29, 2022, meeting with these Leaders, the United States&nbsp; launched the U.S.-Caribbean Partnership to Address the Climate Crisis 2030 (PACC 2030) to facilitate renewable energy infrastructure development, including by increasing access to financing, and to bolster the region’s resilience to climate based natural disasters.&nbsp; The joint effort will facilitate collaboration between the U.S. private sector and Caribbean companies to support renewable energy infrastructure project development from concept to financing, including through technical assistance and blended finance tools to create Caribbean equity in energy projects.&nbsp; Under PACC 2030 and as part of the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, the United States will work with international financial institutions to develop financial tools that respond to the Caribbean’s unique challenges, including by exploring alternatives to the World Bank’s national income criteria for eligibility to concessional or grant financing.</p>



<p>In addition to the Caribbean’s vulnerability to natural disasters, rising international debt, and out-migration, food and nutrition insecurity is on the rise with approximately 67.5% of the population experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity.&nbsp; To address these challenges, the United States and CARICOM will launch a Caribbean Zero Hunger Plan to promote food and nutrition security in the Caribbean.&nbsp; President Biden also announced the United States will provide $28 million in new food security assistance to Caribbean countries.<br><br>The leaders discussed the need to strengthen security cooperation and engagement, including countering small arms trafficking.&nbsp; The United States and Caribbean countries reaffirm longstanding cooperation on core Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) priorities and broader engagement complementary to CBSI, such as combatting trafficking in persons, cybersecurity, and cybercrime.&nbsp; The United States and CARICOM member states support the development of national action plans to counter firearms trafficking, as part of the firearms priority actions and roadmap implementation process. These national action plans can help the United States more effectively tailor our support to CARICOM member countries, to address especially the supply and flow of illegal handguns and assault weapons trafficking throughout the region.&nbsp; The leaders also applaud the work of CBSI countries and CARICOM Implementation Agency for Crime and Security (IMPACS) to implement the firearms trafficking priority actions and the road map.&nbsp; The United States and CARICOM concur on the utility of acceding to the Treaty of San José concerning illicit maritime and air narcotics trafficking. This treaty provides states with a valuable legal mechanism that facilitates international cooperation to disrupt illicit maritime trafficking and transnational criminal organizations in the Caribbean.</p>



<p>Finally, the United States and CARICOM reaffirm our commitment to promoting and defending democracy and the rule of law, as enshrined in the Inter-American Democratic Charter.  Our nations are bound together by shared values, culture, history, and family ties. As governments, we will work in partnership with civil society and the private sector to ensure that democracy delivers for all our people and to build safe, inclusive, prosperous, equitable, and climate-resilient societies.</p>

<p>We, the Heads of State and Government of the Argentine Republic, Barbados, Belize, the Federative Republic of Brazil, Canada, the Republic of Chile, the Republic of Colombia, the Republic of Costa Rica, the Republic of Ecuador, the Republic of El Salvador, the Republic of Guatemala, the Republic of Haiti, the Republic of Honduras, Jamaica, the United Mexican States, the Republic of Panama, the Republic of Paraguay, the Republic of Peru, the United States of America, and the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, gathered in Los Angeles on the margins of the Ninth Summit of the Americas, reiterate our will to strengthen national, regional, and hemispheric efforts to create the conditions for safe, orderly, humane, and regular migration and to strengthen frameworks for international protection and cooperation.</p>



<p>We embrace the need to promote the political, economic, security, social, and environmental conditions for people to lead peaceful, productive, and dignified lives in their countries of origin.&nbsp; Migration should be a voluntary, informed choice and not a necessity.</p>



<p>We are committed to protecting the safety and dignity of all migrants, refugees, asylum seekers, and stateless persons, regardless of their migratory status, and respecting their human rights and fundamental freedoms.&nbsp; We intend to cooperate closely to facilitate safe, orderly, humane, and regular migration and, as appropriate, promote safe and dignified returns, consistent with national legislation, the principle of non-refoulement, and our respective obligations under international law.</p>



<p>We acknowledge that addressing irregular international migration requires a regional approach, and that ongoing health, social, and economic challenges of the pandemic exacerbate the root causes driving irregular migration, including the vulnerabilities of many migrants and their communities.</p>



<p>We value the tradition of our region in welcoming refugees and migrants and showing solidarity with our neighbors.&nbsp; We recognize the positive contributions of refugees and migrants to the socio-economic development of their host communities.&nbsp; We recognize the sustained efforts of States in our hemisphere in hosting refugees, providing regular migration pathways, promoting local economic and social integration, facilitating safe, dignified, and voluntary return, and supporting the sustainable reintegration of returnees.</p>



<p>We remain committed to collectively leveraging the benefits of migration while addressing its challenges in countries and communities of origin, transit, destination, and return.&nbsp; We do so in a spirit of collaboration, solidarity, and shared responsibility among States and in partnership with civil society and international organizations.&nbsp; We reaffirm our shared commitment to supporting host communities; strengthening and expanding regular pathways and access to international protection; fostering opportunities for decent work; facilitating regularization and access to basic services; and promoting principles of safe, orderly, humane, and regular migration.</p>



<p>We also intend to strengthen the institutions that are responsible for migration management in our countries and exchange best practices in order to provide efficient and adequate care to migrants and access to protection for refugees.</p>



<p><strong>Promoting Stability and Assistance for Communities of Destination, Origin, Transit, and Return</strong></p>



<p>We affirm that countries of origin and countries and communities hosting large numbers of migrants and refugees may need international financing and assistance related to development, basic humanitarian needs, protection, security, public health, education, financial inclusion, and employment, among others. &nbsp;We support efforts that allow all migrants, refugees, asylum seekers, and persons in situations of vulnerability to integrate into host countries and access legal identity, regular status, dignified employment, public services, and international protection, when appropriate and in accordance with national legislation, to rebuild their lives and contribute to those communities. &nbsp;We plan to continue efforts to prevent and reduce statelessness.&nbsp; We intend to expand efforts to address the root causes of irregular migration throughout our hemisphere, improving conditions and opportunities in countries of origin and promoting respect for human rights.&nbsp; We reaffirm the importance of safe, dignified, and sustainable return, readmission, and reintegration of migrants to help them reestablish themselves in their communities of origin.&nbsp; We further reaffirm the importance of ensuring all foreign nationals receive prompt consular assistance when needed or requested, and returnees are treated humanely and in a dignified manner, regardless of their immigration status, including in the process of their repatriation and return.</p>



<p><strong>Promoting Regular Pathways for Migration and International Protection</strong></p>



<p>We affirm that regular pathways, including circular and seasonal labor migration opportunities, family reunification, temporary migration mechanisms, and regularization programs promote safer and more orderly migration. &nbsp;We intend to strengthen fair labor migration opportunities in the region, integrating robust safeguards to ensure ethical recruitment and employment free of exploitation, violence, and discrimination, consistent with respect for human rights and with a gender perspective.&nbsp; We intend to promote, in accordance with national legislation, the recognition of qualifications and the portability of social benefits.&nbsp; We intend to pursue accountability for those who commit human rights violations and abuses.&nbsp; We plan to promote access to protection and complementary pathways for asylum seekers, refugees, and stateless persons in accordance with national legislation and with respect for the principle of non-refoulement.&nbsp; We seek to promote border security and management processes that respect human rights and encourage and facilitate lawful, safe, and secure travel within the region.&nbsp; We commit to guarantee human rights to individuals in vulnerable situations and to provide access to international protection, as appropriate.&nbsp; We further intend to provide specialized and gender-responsive attention to individuals in situations of vulnerability.</p>



<p><strong>Promoting Humane Migration Management</strong></p>



<p>Renewing our commitment to respect and ensure the human rights of all migrants and persons in need of international protection, we recognize each country’s responsibility to manage mixed movements across international borders in a secure, humane, orderly, and regular manner.&nbsp; We intend to expand collaborative efforts to save lives, address violence and discrimination, counter xenophobia, and combat smuggling of migrants and trafficking in persons.&nbsp; This includes expanded collaboration to prosecute migrant smuggling and human trafficking criminal organizations as well as their facilitators and money laundering networks.&nbsp; We commit to provide appropriate protection and assistance to victimized individuals.&nbsp; We intend, in accordance with national legislation, to improve and facilitate regional law enforcement information sharing, with the purpose of supporting the investigation and prosecution of crimes. We intend to explore new mechanisms, while preserving and leveraging existing regional, subregional, hemispheric, and global fora, to strengthen cooperation on border management and apply current mechanisms on visa regimes and regularization processes to combat exploitation by criminal groups.&nbsp; In the instance of foreign nationals without a need for international protection and without a legal basis to remain in their country of presence, we commit to conduct any returns in a manner consistent with our respective obligations under international human rights law and international refugee law, and that respects the dignity of the individual, integrates safeguards to prevent refoulement, and promotes the return of children to safe conditions.</p>



<p><strong>Promoting a Coordinated Emergency Response</strong></p>



<p>Recognizing the imperative of promoting safe, orderly, and regular migration, and the safety of migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers in the region, we intend to work to cooperate in emergency response and humanitarian assistance in situations of mass migration and refugee movements.&nbsp; We plan to strengthen existing regional coordination mechanisms and, as appropriate, the participation of civil society and international organizations to advance those aims.&nbsp; This includes strengthening information sharing, as appropriate and in accordance with national legislation, enhancing early warning systems, leveraging existing relevant fora and processes, and defining a common set of triggers that activate a coordinated response.</p>



<p><strong>A Shared Approach to Reduce and Manage Irregular Migration</strong></p>



<p>To advance the common goals laid out in this Declaration and create the conditions for safe, orderly, humane, and regular migration through robust responsibility sharing, we intend to work together across the hemisphere to:</p>



<ul><li>Convene multilateral development banks, international financial institutions, and traditional and non-traditional donors to review financial support instruments for countries hosting migrant populations and facing other migration challenges, without prejudice to existing financing priorities and programs.</li></ul>



<ul><li>&nbsp;Improve regional cooperation mechanisms for law enforcement cooperation, information sharing, protection-sensitive border management, visa regimes, and regularization processes, as appropriate and in accordance with national legislation.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Strengthen and expand temporary labor migration pathways, as feasible, that benefit countries across the region, including through new programs promoting connections between employers and migrant workers, robust safeguards for ethical recruitment, and legal protections for workers’ rights.</li></ul>



<ul><li>&nbsp;Improve access to public and private services for all migrants, refugees, and stateless persons to promote their full social and economic inclusion in host communities.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Expand access to regular pathways for migrants and refugees to include family reunification options where appropriate and feasible, in accordance with national legislation.</li></ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>This Declaration builds upon existing efforts and international commitments and advances the vision set forth in the Global Compact on Refugees and the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM) anchored in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.&nbsp; We acknowledge the progress noted in the International Migration Review Forum Progress Declaration for the GCM.&nbsp; We affirm the fundamental work that continues under the Comprehensive Regional Protection and Solutions Framework (MIRPS), the Regional Conference on Migration (RCM), and the South American Conference on Migration (SACM), as key regional bodies to facilitate the implementation of this Declaration, as well as the Quito Process and the Regional Inter-agency Coordination Platform for refugees and migrants from Venezuela.&nbsp; The United Nations 1951 Refugee Convention; its 1967 Protocol; the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and International Humanitarian Law; the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime; its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children; its Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air; the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child; the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members of their Families; as well as other international conventions,&nbsp;remain binding on Parties to those conventions that endorse this Declaration.&nbsp; This Declaration aligns with States’ commitments in the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its General Principles and Operational Guidelines for Fair Recruitment.&nbsp; We reiterate the importance and meaning of the principle of non-refoulement as a cornerstone of the international protection of refugees.&nbsp; We applaud efforts throughout the region to provide a coordinated and comprehensive response to all migrants, returnees, refugees, asylum seekers, and stateless persons. &nbsp;We make this Declaration of non-legally binding commitments to enhance cooperation and shared responsibilities on managing migration and protection in ways grounded in human rights, transparency, nondiscrimination, and State sovereignty.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">USS Iowa<br>Port of Los Angeles <br>Los Angeles, California</p>



<p>10:51 A.M. PDT</p>



<p>     THE PRESIDENT:  As we used to say in the United States Senate, I hope you’ll excuse a point of personal privilege, but I think that Sal must be related closely to my good friend from Holy Rosary High School in Claymont, Mike DiCostanzo (ph).  (Laughter.)  You think I’m kidding.  (Laughs.)  I’m not.</p>



<p>I tell you what &#8212; but anyway, thank you, Sal.</p>



<p>Look, everybody, before I begin, I want to say a few words very briefly about the January 6th hearings that were highlighted last night.</p>



<p>The insurrection on January 6th is one of the darkest chapters in our nation’s history.&nbsp; A brutal assault on our democracy.&nbsp; A brutal attack on law enforcement &#8212; some losing their lives.&nbsp; And we &#8212; and we heard about it last night again.</p>



<p>It’s important that the American people understand what truly happened and to understand that the same forces that led January 6th remain at work today.&nbsp; It’s about our democracy itself.</p>



<p>We have to protect our democracy.&nbsp; I know it sounds corny to say it.&nbsp; We were all raised in school that democracy &#8212; every generation has to protect it.&nbsp; I have to admit to you, I never thought that it was going to be this straightforward a challenge before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rule of law matters in democracies.&nbsp; And we’re seeing how the battle for the soul of America has been far from won.</p>



<p>But I know, together &#8212; and I mean this &#8212; we can unite and defend this nation, Democrat and Republican, and allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy.</p>



<p>That’s what those hearings are all about.&nbsp; You’re going to hear a lot more.&nbsp; I didn’t get to watch them last night because I was doing other business.&nbsp; But I tell you what: There’s a lot &#8212; a lot going on.</p>



<p>Now, look, to the reason I’m here.&nbsp; You know, thank you, Sal.&nbsp; And thanks to Gene and the Port of Los Angeles, as well.&nbsp; Mario, thank you, for the Port of Long Beach.&nbsp; And thank Mayor Garcetti of Los Angeles and the Mayor of Long Beach, who I suspect is soon going to be the Congressman of Long Beach, the way it looks like.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>You guys did a heck of a job when I came out here a couple years ago to try to get things moving.&nbsp; Everybody did &#8212; management, labor, the elected leaders.&nbsp; As well as, at the time, we also had Governor Newsom pushing hard as well.</p>



<p>Look, we have two excellent senators: Dianne Feinstein and Alex Padilla.&nbsp; I tell you what, Alex &#8212; (applause) &#8212; you don’t look any worse for the wear, man.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; You’re looking awful good.&nbsp; You’re looking awful good.</p>



<p>And, Nanette, I &#8212; I think you’ve always looked good, particularly compared to these guys.&nbsp; You know what I mean?&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And me.&nbsp; But seriously, thank you, Nanette, for the fire you bring.&nbsp; You bring some fire to this.&nbsp; I really mean it.&nbsp; It’s in your heart.</p>



<p>And Alan Lowenthal has been working on this for a long time.&nbsp; Alan and I just had a little meeting together.&nbsp; We got to change it, Alan.&nbsp; We’ve got &#8212; we can’t &#8212; we can’t give up.&nbsp; We got to turn this corner.</p>



<p>And, John, I can’t thank you.&nbsp; You’re &#8212; you’re the real deal.&nbsp; Anybody &#8212; well, I won’t get into &#8212; get you in trouble, but thanks for sticking up for me.</p>



<p>And, look &#8212; and we have a Labor Secretary that &#8212; I’m his translator.&nbsp; He’s “Marty Walsh from Boston.”&nbsp; (Pronounced in Boston accent.)&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And &#8212; but if you need any- &#8212; the only thing you got to know: He always has your back.&nbsp; He always has your back.&nbsp; I had an uncle who used to say, “Joey, you’re labor from belt buckle to shoe sole.”&nbsp; Well, he’s labor from forehead to the tip of his toes.&nbsp; He used to run a labor’s outf- &#8212; union.</p>



<p>Look, folks, today I’d like to speak about my top economic priority: fighting inflation.&nbsp; I understand Americans are anxious, and they’re anxious with good reason.&nbsp; I was raised in a household when the price of gasoline rose precipitously, it was the discussion at the table.&nbsp; It made a difference when food prices went up.</p>



<p>But we&#8217;ve never seen anything like Putin&#8217;s tax on both food and gas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Americans should also understand our economy has unique strengths that we can build on.&nbsp; The job market is the strongest it’s been since World War Two, notwithstanding the inflation.&nbsp; We added another 390,000 jobs last month; 8,700,000 new jobs since I took office.&nbsp; An all-time record.&nbsp; Never that many jobs in that period of time.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>Unemployment rate is near historic lows.&nbsp; Millions of Americans are moving up to better jobs and better pay.</p>



<p>And since I took office, families are carrying less debt on average in America.&nbsp; They have more savings than they’ve had.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we’re doing it all while cutting the federal deficit by $1.7 trillion this year and $320 billion last.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>If I hear one of my MAGA friends once again talk about debt and deficits, I&#8217;m going to &#8212; anyway &#8212; I’m going to be good.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; They increased the deficit by 2 trillion bucks.&nbsp; Anyway, that&#8217;s another story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, look, this is the largest decline in American history.&nbsp; Because of the progress, America can tackle inflation from a position of strength unlike any other country in the world, because every country in the world is getting a big bite and piece of this inflation &#8212; worse than we are in the vast majority of countries around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But make no mistake about it: I understand inflation is a real challenge to American families.</p>



<p>Today’s inflation report confirmed what Americans already know: Putin’s price hike is hitting America hard.</p>



<p>Gas prices at the pump.&nbsp; Energy and food prices account for half of the monthly price increases since May.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inflation, outside of energy and food &#8212; what the economists call “core inflation” &#8212; moderated the last two months.&nbsp; Not enough, but it moderated; it’s come down.&nbsp; And we need it to come down much more quickly.</p>



<p>My administration is going to continue to do everything we can to lower the prices for the American people.&nbsp; And the Congress has to act, and they have been of late.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the key ways to fight inflation is by lowering the cost of moving goods through the supply chain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I first started talking about the supply chain, when I came here well over a year ago, the American people understandably wondered, “Supply chain &#8212; what…” &#8212; I mean, that’s not a usual part of their jargon every day.&nbsp; But they understand it fully now.&nbsp; They understand it.</p>



<p>If you can&#8217;t get the material needed to build a product you&#8217;re building &#8212; whether it&#8217;s an automobile or whatever it is &#8212; it makes it difficult to be able to move, and that&#8217;s called the supply chain.&nbsp; That’s why I’ve been focused on ports.</p>



<p>Last fall, ports around the world were congested due to disruption caused by the pandemic, so we brought together port operators, shipping companies, and labor and &#8212; to ease the bottlenecks.&nbsp; And as a result, over the holidays last, 97 percent of all the packages were delivered on time and on shelves when you went Christmas shopping.&nbsp; Remember, we weren&#8217;t going to have anything on those shelves.&nbsp; You all did it.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; No, no, not a joke.&nbsp; You did it on time with minimal delay.&nbsp; Delivery times were actually quicker than they were before the pandemic.</p>



<p>And today, there are about 40 percent fewer containers clogging the docks on long pe- &#8212; for long periods of time than there were last November.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This May was the strongest month in the Port of Los Angeles’s history &#8212; the strongest month in its history.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>



<p>And we’re helping fund improvements.&nbsp; Because of what my friends in the Congress have done, we passed the &#8212; we passed the Infrastructure Bill and we&#8217;re funding major new initiatives on the docks &#8212; on-dock rail systems, the Port of Long Beach &#8212; move goods more quickly.&nbsp; And port electrification so communications near the ports can be &#8212; and communities can breathe cleaner air because they’re using electric machines that are not generating using gas, coal, et cetera.</p>



<p>And we’re continuing to expand capacity of our ports, thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look, this is a time &#8212; we took a different approach also to trucking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember, last December, we brought together industry and labor to tackle problems facing truck drivers.&nbsp; It took the double &#8212; we had to double the number of commercial driver licenses being issued by the states in order to speed things up.&nbsp; We did it.&nbsp; We sped the creation and registration of apprenticeships, allowing aspiring drivers to earn while they were learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The result?&nbsp; We hit a record-setting employment in trucking earlier this year.&nbsp; And truckers’ wages went up even after accounting for inflation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a>We’re going to keep at it with a new <s>Super</s> [Supply] Chain Envoy, General Steve Lyons.&nbsp; General Lyons is a four-star general.&nbsp; He handled the transportation of a little bit of a thing &#8212; he had Transportation Command &#8212; only tens of millions of billions of tons of things to move, from little things like tanks, and aircraft, and all of that.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>But all kidding aside, he&#8217;s come off the sidelines.&nbsp; He&#8217;s retired.&nbsp; He&#8217;s helped us identify and get ahead of the challenges that raise &#8212; that &#8212; that arise at our ports, our railroads, and on the road.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is about reducing costs for families.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know, I have to admit to you, a lot of us elected officials have been in office for a while.&nbsp; Every once in a while, something you learn makes you viscerally angry.&nbsp; Like if you had the person in front of you, you&#8217;d want to pop them.&nbsp; No, I really mean it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are nine &#8212; nine major ocean line shipping companies that ship from Asia to the United States.&nbsp; Nine.&nbsp; They form three consortia.&nbsp; These companies have raised their prices by as much as 1,000 percent.&nbsp; So everything coming from Asia, they &#8212; they get 90-some percent of it &#8212; the stuff coming from Asia.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve raised it by 1,000 percent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why I called on Congress to crack down on &#8212; and they&#8217;re foreign owned &#8212; foreign-owned shipping companies that raise their prices while raking in, just last year, $190 billion in profit &#8212; a seven-fold increase in one year.&nbsp; Seven-fold increase &#8212; $190 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Senate passed legislation.&nbsp; I&#8217;m hopeful the House is going to act soon to crack down on these companies, as I&#8217;ve asked, and lower the cost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I&#8217;m grateful to two Californians, Speaker Pelosi and John Garamendi, for &#8212; for leading this effort.&nbsp; Thanks, John.&nbsp; I really mean it.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a big deal.&nbsp; People at home trying to make it, you know, paycheck to paycheck are wondering, “Well, like, what in God&#8217;s name do nine” &#8212; understandably &#8212; “would nine shipping companies have to do with it?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, almost everything you&#8217;re doing &#8212; everything from what you&#8217;re eating to what you’re having to drive, to what you&#8217;re &#8212; with what you need in your home is related to supply chains and what&#8217;s coming from abroad.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m doing everything in my power to blunt Putin&#8217;s price hike and bring down the cost of gas and food.&nbsp; I led the world to coordinate the largest release of global oil reserves in history &#8212; 240 million barrels &#8212; to boost supply to keep prices from rising even more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to America&#8217;s leadership and diplomacy, we&#8217;ve helped Europe reduce its reliance on Russian oil by tripling our natural gas systems to Europe compared to last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I&#8217;m working closely with our European partners to get 20 million tons of grain locked in Ukraine.&nbsp; Already in their silos now.&nbsp; Ukraine and Russia, the two major suppliers of grain and corn, they have 20 million barrels &#8212; I mean 20 million in &#8212; in their &#8212; in their silos right now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we&#8217;re trying to help them to get that, and the Russians are blocking the export.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not allowed out through the Black Sea.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re trying to figure out how to get it out of the country to get he- &#8212; to &#8212; around the world.&nbsp; It will bring down prices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there&#8217;s more &#8212; there&#8217;s more than one way to solve this problem.&nbsp; We&#8217;re continuing working to bring down food prices and gas prices to save families mother &#8212; money by dealing with other items.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My dad used to say it&#8217;s all about the standard of living &#8212; how much you have left in the paycheck at the end of the month, how much is left to do the basic things.</p>



<p>So, if you add up all the things that people need just to do their &#8212; to do everything from take care of their kids to turn the heat on or the air conditioning on and everything in between, there&#8217;s a lot of ways we can reduce their cost, their cost of living, other than if we &#8212; while we&#8217;re trying to get at &#8212; at the grain and &#8212; and gas.</p>



<p>We laid out a plan.&nbsp; For example, lower prescription drug costs; that would fundamentally affect the wellbeing of every family.&nbsp; Those of you who know somebody who has Type 2 diabetes and has in- &#8212; has an insulin requirement monthly, you know it costs an average of $647 a month.&nbsp; It can cost as high as $1,000 in some place.&nbsp;&nbsp; You know how much it costs to make that one little vial of insulin?&nbsp; Ten dollars.&nbsp; T-E-N.&nbsp; Ten dollars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No new research has been done since that was &#8212; was invented.&nbsp; And the charging is outrageous.&nbsp; So I think we should be able to have the Medicare do what they do when they deal with the VA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The VA says, “We’re only going to pay you so much for this, if you don&#8217;t want to…” &#8212; and because they &#8212; Medicare negotiates the price for them.&nbsp; Well, if Medicare is able to negotiate the price on insulin, guess what?&nbsp; It comes down a whole hell of a lot.&nbsp; Outrageous numbers.</p>



<p>So we could put a cap on insulin at $35 a month and they&#8217;ll still make a significant profit.&nbsp; Ten bucks to manufacture; thirty-five bucks.</p>



<p>For example, we can begin by lowering the cost of high-speed Internet because of what y&#8217;all did dealing with the &#8212; with the Infrastructure Bill.&nbsp; Working with the service providers, we cut the price and rise &#8212; raised the speed, potentially lowering high-speed Internet bills on average, for an average family, $30 a month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Okay, well, you made &#8212; you&#8217;re paying an extra more than $30 a month for your gas, but that still increases the money out of pocket &#8212; decreases the amount you have to put out.</p>



<p>The point is: We&#8217;re doing everything in our power to lower costs to families, but congressional Republicans, led by Senator Rick Scott, have a different approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if you didn’t write it down, you’d think I was making it up, and I mean it sincerely.&nbsp; Rick Scott tried to change his words yesterday, by the way, after he introduced this legis- &#8212; he’d been campaigning.</p>



<p>He’s the guy that had the recon- &#8212; the re-election of the senators for &#8212; on the Republican side.&nbsp; He realized that raising taxes on working families is a little unpopular.&nbsp; He said, “Everybody, no matter what their station, if they don&#8217;t &#8212; if they&#8217;re on welfare &#8212; should have &#8212; pay a tax.&nbsp; Everybody should pay a tax.”</p>



<p>Well, but here&#8217;s the truth: One concrete plan that they laid out was going to raise taxes on working families an average of $1,500 a month, while we have 54 corporations out there who didn&#8217;t pay any tax for the last two years and made $40 billion.&nbsp; They don&#8217;t want to tax them at all.&nbsp; They don&#8217;t want to tax billionaires who are literally paying a lower tax rate than longshoremen are paying, literally, on a percentage basis.</p>



<p>So he hasn&#8217;t walked back from his plans.</p>



<p>On healthcare, he says what we have to do &#8212; now that we finally got the Affordable Care Act functioning and the price is down an average of 400 bucks for people, he wants to eliminate it.&nbsp; Again, we’re back at “want to eliminate it” again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So &#8212; and, by the way, the one that&#8217;s the best thing that the Republicans are pushing now in the re-election is that they think that Medicare &#8212; I&#8217;m not making this up; go online and look &#8212; Medicare, Social Security, and Medicare &#8212; Medicaid &#8212; go on the chopping block every five years.&nbsp; What that means is: At the end of five years, they go out of existence unless they&#8217;re affirmatively voted back into existence &#8212; every five years. Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And they forget people paid for their Social Security.&nbsp; They paid for it.&nbsp; And you know what&#8217;s going to happen?&nbsp; People will say, “Well, they&#8217;ll never eliminate it all.”&nbsp; But they&#8217;ll &#8212; what they&#8217;ll do, they&#8217;ll be able to pick it apart.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll be able to cut it back.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the whole objective.</p>



<p>And, folks, you know, it’s not right.&nbsp; It’s simply not right.&nbsp; And I disagree.&nbsp; And that’s what &#8212; look, this is not your father’s Republican Party; this is a different deal.&nbsp; It really is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve worked with a lot of honorable Republicans &#8212; very conservative Republicans &#8212; over the years when I was a senator.&nbsp; But this is the MAGA gang.&nbsp; This is the MAGA crowd.&nbsp; I really mean it.&nbsp; They have a fundamentally different view of the role of government and who should pay what.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m going to work with anyone &#8212; Democrat, Republican, or independent &#8212; to deliver real solutions for families.</p>



<p>Look, because of the strong foundation we built, we&#8217;re better positioned than just about any country in the world to overcome global &#8212; the global inflation we&#8217;re seeing and to take the next step towards forming a historic recovery and a new moment.&nbsp; And I count “recovery” as going from where we are today, in terms of the economy, to stability &#8212; to make it stable.&nbsp; It is strong as can be but for inflation, but for gas and food.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, look, we have to keep go- &#8212; we have to keep coming together to find common ground to solve problems, like we&#8217;ve done in ports and in trucking.&nbsp; We continue to build the extraordinary progress we&#8217;ve made.&nbsp; So we got to continue building this economy from the bottom up and the middle out.&nbsp; And I mean that literally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am so sick and tired of trickle-down economics.&nbsp; It does not work.&nbsp; When the middle class is doing well &#8212; and they do well because of labor &#8212; when the middle class is doing well, the poor have a way up and the wealthy do very, very well.&nbsp; They have never been hurt when the middle class is doing well.&nbsp; Never.&nbsp; Never.</p>



<p>So, it&#8217;s about time we start to regather and remember who we are and get a lot of this done.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s no better place to starting it than right here in the port and letting those nine foreign shippers understand the rip-off is over.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; All right.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you going to go after Exxon’s profits, sir?&nbsp; Exxon’s profits &#8212; are you going to &#8212; are you going to go after them?</p>



<p>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to make sure that everybody knows Exxon&#8217;s profits.&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t you tell them what Exxon’s profits were this year &#8212; this quarter?&nbsp; Exxon made more money than God this year.&nbsp; And, by the way, nothing has changed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And they&#8217;re not &#8212; by the way, one thing I want to say about the oil companies: They talk about how we have &#8212; they have 9,000 permits to drill.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not drilling.&nbsp; Why aren&#8217;t they drilling?&nbsp; Because they make more money not producing more oil.&nbsp; The price goes up, number one.&nbsp; And, number two, the reason they&#8217;re not drilling is they&#8217;re buying back their own stock &#8212; which should be taxed, quite frankly &#8212; buying back their own stock and making no new investments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I &#8212; I always thought Republicans are for investment.&nbsp; Exxon, start investing, start paying your taxes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center</em><em><br>Columbia, South Carolina</em><br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>7:55 P.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;<br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; Good &#8212; or good evening.&nbsp; Good evening.&nbsp; Good evening, South Carolina.&nbsp; Good evening.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Can we please here it for Jaleel Johnson?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I am so, so proud of him.&nbsp; I know we all are.&nbsp; When I see Jaleel and I see our young leaders, I tell you, I know the future of our country is so bright.&nbsp; And, you know, the last time &#8212; as I look &#8212; the last time I saw Jaleel, he had just graduated high school, and now here he is.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, it is good to be with all of you.&nbsp; And, Trav Robertson, I want to thank you for your leadership and your support over the years.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And it was such a joy to be with your father this evening and to &#8212; and to visit with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And, of course, it’s so good to be with so many friends and back to see you all here in the great Palmetto State.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I am honored to join you also on a night when you celebrate Governor Dick Riley &#8212; (applause) &#8212; a great leader for this state on public school education and diversity.&nbsp; For so long, he&#8217;s been fighting &#8212; fighting for our children.&nbsp; And, of course, that’s why then-President Clinton put him in as Secretary of Education and brought that commitment &#8212; is what he did &#8212; to our nation’s schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Of course, to think about South Carolina Democrats is to think about Majority Whip James Clyburn.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Whip Clyburn, I have always appreciated your leadership and your friendship and your counsel over the years.&nbsp; And I have seen you in the halls of Congress, when the cameras are on and when they are off, and you are always &#8212; he is always fighting for the people of South Carolina and the people of our country. &nbsp;(Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>So, as all of you know, I have spent a lot of time in this state &#8212; from upstate to the midlands, from Pee Dee to the Lowcountry.&nbsp; We have prayed together.&nbsp; We have celebrated birthdays together.&nbsp; We have shared home-cooked meals.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And of the many things, I&#8217;m going to tell you, that I do admire about the people of South Carolina &#8212; and there are many &#8212; of the many things that I admire: Whether you are debating mustard versus vinegar &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; or bragging about how the sweetest comes from your neighbor’s farm, you are serious about your food.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, with that, I&#8217;m going to share with you a real quick story, and then I&#8217;m going to get on to my &#8212; my comments.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, I was here &#8212; of the many visits, one of those visits was in late November of 2019.&nbsp; And I had just finished an event about the importance of mental health.&nbsp; We were in Goose Creek, and I was there with JA Moore and Charlamagne Tha God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And &#8212; and I was about to head out of town to meet my family and cook for Thanksgiving.&nbsp; I won&#8217;t mention where I was going, but where I was going, I knew I was not going to be able to find the kind of greens there that I could get here.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And so, yes, that was me, in my suit and heels, walking through Charleston International Airport, carrying two big plastic bags full of fresh South Carolina collard greens.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; It’s a true story.<br>&nbsp;<br>And, yes, as I walked on the plane, there were a few people who gave me the look &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; and the nod.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And, South Carolina, you are also serious about your politics.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And so it is my honor tonight to share with you many thoughts, including a message direct from the President of the United States, who I just left in California to come here.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I was there for the Summit of the Americas where we actually brought together heads of state from around the world, civil society, and CEOs.&nbsp; And, in fact, I convened a smaller group of prime ministers and presidents from the Caribbean to talk about the issue of the climate crisis and how that is affecting those countries.<br>&nbsp;<br>But we were there talking about the most pressing issues of our time.&nbsp; And as I was leaving, Joe asked me to pass on a message, and the message is, from both of us: South Carolina, we see you.&nbsp; We see &#8212; (applause) &#8212; we see how the power of South Carolina Democrats is felt all over our nation.&nbsp; We see how your state party leaders rise up to become national party leaders, from the dear and late Don Fowler to Jaime Harrison.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We see &#8212; we see how South Carolina brings critical representation to the presidential nominating process.&nbsp; And we see the great Jim Clyburn &#8212; his leadership in Washington, D.C.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And we see &#8212; and we see how South Carolina Democrats set President Joe Biden and me on a path to the White House.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>So, South Carolina Democrats, the President and I want you to know something else.&nbsp; We see all the work you did to help get us elected, and we heard you when you told us about the issues that matter to you most.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We heard you, South Carolina, when Jim Clyburn called broadband an issue of economic justice in America.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And so we are making record investments to connect more people in rural communities to high-speed Internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We heard you, South Carolina, when you said the people of this state want more resources to go to some of the best schools in the world.&nbsp; So we are making historic investments in our HBCUs, including &#8212; (applause) &#8212; including $112 million to schools right here in the Palmetto State.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>We heard you when you said you just wanted an opportunity for folks to be able to build wealth, not only for their family today, but for generations to come.&nbsp; So we are fighting to make sure Black farmers keep ownership of their land.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And we are making billions of dollars in capital available for minority- and women-owned small businesses, businesses &#8212; (applause) &#8212; like the ones I visited right here in Columbia, on Lady Street.<br>&nbsp;<br>We heard you when you said people wanted just a little more help to stand on their own two feet.&nbsp; So we are making healthcare more affordable and fighting to protect Social Security and Medicare.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>We heard you.&nbsp; We heard you.&nbsp; And because of your efforts to get us elected in 2020, we were able to issue an executive order to increase accountability and policing, including a ban on chokeholds for federal law enforcement.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>For the first time in 122 years, lynching is finally a federal crime.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>And, of course, an outstanding jurist by the name of Ketanji Brown Jackson will be on the highest court of our land.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Fulfilling, by the way &#8212; I&#8217;m sure everyone here remembers &#8212; fulfilling, by the way, a promise that President Biden made right here in South Carolina.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And we are also proud to have appointed the most diverse group of judges in the history of the United States judiciary to the federal bench &#8212; (applause) &#8212; including South Carolina&#8217;s own phenomenal Michelle Childs.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So all of this to say: Thank you, South Carolina.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; You’re welcome!<br>&nbsp;<br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; And you&#8217;re always so polite and proper.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br>&nbsp;<br>So the President and I, we were sworn into office, as we all remember, at a time when our nation was facing a pandemic that was out of control, an economy that was in freefall, and questions about America&#8217;s leadership on the world stage.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But we were not deterred.&nbsp; We knew what you sent us to Washington to accomplish.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And what did we do?&nbsp; Well, hundreds of millions of Americans got vaccinated.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>What did we do?&nbsp; Record job creation.&nbsp; Record decline in unemployment.&nbsp; Record increases in labor participation.&nbsp; And a historic rate of small-business creation.<br>&nbsp;<br>We have made progress.&nbsp; And we know people are still hurting.&nbsp; There is no question we still face serious challenges.&nbsp; As we saw today, inflation is still too high.&nbsp; We are seeing higher prices at the store from supply chains that slowed down dramatically during the pandemic, and higher prices at the gas pump because of Putin&#8217;s war in Ukraine.&nbsp; Families across South Carolina and the nation are feeling the pinch.<br>&nbsp;<br>And the President and I are using every tool at our disposal to lower costs.&nbsp; We are fighting every day to keep our country on the path towards stable, steady growth.<br>&nbsp;<br>You know, the last time that I spoke at this convention, I spoke about my belief that the greatest strength that anyone has is measured in their ability to lift up other people.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And I know we share that belief.&nbsp; I know we share that belief.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As Democrats, we are fueled by a common purpose: to help all people succeed and to achieve their own version of the American Dream.<br>&nbsp;<br>Democrats stand for the fundamental principle that we are all created equal, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or sexual orientation.&nbsp; We stand for unity.&nbsp; We stand for coalition building, guided by the knowledge that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>And, friends, I believe when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; As Democrats, we fight for a future where working families can get ahead and stay ahead, where every child can reach their God-given potential, and where every community is safe and healthy.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We fight for a future where all people can live without fear.&nbsp; Because no 86-year-old grandmother should be afraid to go to the grocery store.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; No 41-year-old pastor should worry about welcoming a stranger to Bible study.&nbsp; No 9-year-old child should fear for her safety at school.&nbsp; And no 18-year-old should be able to buy a weapon of war.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>As Democrats, we fight for a future where anyone can start and grow a business and where workers can earn a fair wage and are treated with respect; a future where all Americans can live and love without government interference, and, yes, where every woman has the liberty and freedom to make decisions about her own body.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>These are the values Democrats stand for.&nbsp; And let&#8217;s be clear: And so much of this is what the Republican Party stands against.&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Think about it:&nbsp;So, since the last time we all gathered in the United States Senate, not one Republican voted to rescue our nation in the middle of a pandemic.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Think about it: Not one Republican voted to extend the Child Tax Credit, which lifted up to 40 percent of America&#8217;s children out of poverty.&nbsp; (Applause.) &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Think about it: Not one Republican voted to protect women and keep their health decisions private.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And not one Republican voted to protect our most fundamental right: the right to vote.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Not one.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Republican Party wants to criminalize and punish women and their doctors for making healthcare decisions.&nbsp; They are fighting tooth and nail to keep people away from the ballot box, even passing laws that make it illegal to give folks food and water if they&#8217;re waiting in line.&nbsp; (Applause.) &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And it doesn&#8217;t stop there.&nbsp; At every turn, Republican leaders have shown that they have no interest in making progress on the issues that matter most to the American people and that they would rather allow an epidemic of hate to accelerate than to sincerely work to heal our country.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>They even reject the most modest reforms to address police misconduct.&nbsp; They want to end the guarantee of Social Security and Medicare in just five years that would devastate our seniors.&nbsp; And they continue to threaten our healthcare.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Some extremist leaders even promoted conspiracy theories that led to an attack on our nation&#8217;s capital &#8212; an attack that far too many elected Republicans still refuse to condemn.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>As I&#8217;m sure most of us saw during last night&#8217;s hearing, what happened&nbsp;on January 6th&nbsp;was not just an assault on a building, it was an assault on the institution&#8217;s values and ideals that generations of Americans marched, picketed, and shed blood to establish and defend.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>South Carolina, we are not going to let arsonists set a fire to our democracy.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Our children, our nieces and nephews, our godchildren, our grandchildren, they deserve the future that Democrats can build &#8212; a future where every American can support their family; take care of their health; feel safe in their homes, in their churches, in their schools.<br>&nbsp;<br>The task before us now is to fight for that future.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; Fight!<br>&nbsp;<br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Fight.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; That’s why the President and I need you.&nbsp; We need you.&nbsp; We need you for so many reasons.&nbsp; We need you to register people to vote.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We need you to knock on doors and to talk with your neighbors and friends about what is at stake in November, because everything we have discussed tonight is at stake.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So I&#8217;m here to thank you and to ask that of you, and to ask you: Please send Jim Clyburn back to Washington, D.C., as the House Majority Whip.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Let us protect and increase our majority in the United States Senate.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>Let us fight to get Democrats up and down state ballots in our country.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I look out this big room at all of you and I know who you are, and I know what you stand for.&nbsp; And this fall, we need you once again to show the nation that South Carolina Democrats know how to do it.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>I promise you the President and I will be with you every step of the way.&nbsp; I thank you.&nbsp; I thank you.&nbsp; God bless you and God bless America.&nbsp; Thank you all.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center</em><em><br>Columbia, South Carolina</em><br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>7:55 P.M. EDT<br>&nbsp;<br>THE VICE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; Good &#8212; or good evening.&nbsp; Good evening.&nbsp; Good evening, South Carolina.&nbsp; Good evening.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Can we please here it for Jaleel Johnson?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I am so, so proud of him.&nbsp; I know we all are.&nbsp; When I see Jaleel and I see our young leaders, I tell you, I know the future of our country is so bright.&nbsp; And, you know, the last time &#8212; as I look &#8212; the last time I saw Jaleel, he had just graduated high school, and now here he is.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, it is good to be with all of you.&nbsp; And, Trav Robertson, I want to thank you for your leadership and your support over the years.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And it was such a joy to be with your father this evening and to &#8212; and to visit with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And, of course, it’s so good to be with so many friends and back to see you all here in the great Palmetto State.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I am honored to join you also on a night when you celebrate Governor Dick Riley &#8212; (applause) &#8212; a great leader for this state on public school education and diversity.&nbsp; For so long, he&#8217;s been fighting &#8212; fighting for our children.&nbsp; And, of course, that’s why then-President Clinton put him in as Secretary of Education and brought that commitment &#8212; is what he did &#8212; to our nation’s schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Of course, to think about South Carolina Democrats is to think about Majority Whip James Clyburn.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Whip Clyburn, I have always appreciated your leadership and your friendship and your counsel over the years.&nbsp; And I have seen you in the halls of Congress, when the cameras are on and when they are off, and you are always &#8212; he is always fighting for the people of South Carolina and the people of our country. &nbsp;(Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>So, as all of you know, I have spent a lot of time in this state &#8212; from upstate to the midlands, from Pee Dee to the Lowcountry.&nbsp; We have prayed together.&nbsp; We have celebrated birthdays together.&nbsp; We have shared home-cooked meals.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And of the many things, I&#8217;m going to tell you, that I do admire about the people of South Carolina &#8212; and there are many &#8212; of the many things that I admire: Whether you are debating mustard versus vinegar &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; or bragging about how the sweetest comes from your neighbor’s farm, you are serious about your food.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so, with that, I&#8217;m going to share with you a real quick story, and then I&#8217;m going to get on to my &#8212; my comments.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, I was here &#8212; of the many visits, one of those visits was in late November of 2019.&nbsp; And I had just finished an event about the importance of mental health.&nbsp; We were in Goose Creek, and I was there with JA Moore and Charlamagne Tha God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And &#8212; and I was about to head out of town to meet my family and cook for Thanksgiving.&nbsp; I won&#8217;t mention where I was going, but where I was going, I knew I was not going to be able to find the kind of greens there that I could get here.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And so, yes, that was me, in my suit and heels, walking through Charleston International Airport, carrying two big plastic bags full of fresh South Carolina collard greens.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; It’s a true story.<br>&nbsp;<br>And, yes, as I walked on the plane, there were a few people who gave me the look &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; and the nod.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And, South Carolina, you are also serious about your politics.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And so it is my honor tonight to share with you many thoughts, including a message direct from the President of the United States, who I just left in California to come here.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I was there for the Summit of the Americas where we actually brought together heads of state from around the world, civil society, and CEOs.&nbsp; And, in fact, I convened a smaller group of prime ministers and presidents from the Caribbean to talk about the issue of the climate crisis and how that is affecting those countries.<br>&nbsp;<br>But we were there talking about the most pressing issues of our time.&nbsp; And as I was leaving, Joe asked me to pass on a message, and the message is, from both of us: South Carolina, we see you.&nbsp; We see &#8212; (applause) &#8212; we see how the power of South Carolina Democrats is felt all over our nation.&nbsp; We see how your state party leaders rise up to become national party leaders, from the dear and late Don Fowler to Jaime Harrison.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We see &#8212; we see how South Carolina brings critical representation to the presidential nominating process.&nbsp; And we see the great Jim Clyburn &#8212; his leadership in Washington, D.C.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And we see &#8212; and we see how South Carolina Democrats set President Joe Biden and me on a path to the White House.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>So, South Carolina Democrats, the President and I want you to know something else.&nbsp; We see all the work you did to help get us elected, and we heard you when you told us about the issues that matter to you most.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We heard you, South Carolina, when Jim Clyburn called broadband an issue of economic justice in America.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And so we are making record investments to connect more people in rural communities to high-speed Internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We heard you, South Carolina, when you said the people of this state want more resources to go to some of the best schools in the world.&nbsp; So we are making historic investments in our HBCUs, including &#8212; (applause) &#8212; including $112 million to schools right here in the Palmetto State.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>We heard you when you said you just wanted an opportunity for folks to be able to build wealth, not only for their family today, but for generations to come.&nbsp; So we are fighting to make sure Black farmers keep ownership of their land.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And we are making billions of dollars in capital available for minority- and women-owned small businesses, businesses &#8212; (applause) &#8212; like the ones I visited right here in Columbia, on Lady Street.<br>&nbsp;<br>We heard you when you said people wanted just a little more help to stand on their own two feet.&nbsp; So we are making healthcare more affordable and fighting to protect Social Security and Medicare.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>We heard you.&nbsp; We heard you.&nbsp; And because of your efforts to get us elected in 2020, we were able to issue an executive order to increase accountability and policing, including a ban on chokeholds for federal law enforcement.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>For the first time in 122 years, lynching is finally a federal crime.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br>&nbsp;<br>And, of course, an outstanding jurist by the name of Ketanji Brown Jackson will be on the highest court of our land.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Fulfilling, by the way &#8212; I&#8217;m sure everyone here remembers &#8212; fulfilling, by the way, a promise that President Biden made right here in South Carolina.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And we are also proud to have appointed the most diverse group of judges in the history of the United States judiciary to the federal bench &#8212; (applause) &#8212; including South Carolina&#8217;s own phenomenal Michelle Childs.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So all of this to say: Thank you, South Carolina.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp;

<p>Today’s report underscores why I have made fighting inflation my top economic priority. While it is good to see critical “core” inflation moderating, it is not coming down as sharply and as quickly as we must see. Putin’s Price Hike hit hard in May here and around the world: high gas prices at the pump, energy, and food prices accounted for around half of the monthly price increases, and gas pump prices are up by $2 a gallon in many places since Russian troops began to threaten Ukraine. Even as we continue our work to defend freedom in Ukraine, we must do more—and quickly—to get prices down here in the United States.</p>



<p>My Administration will continue to do everything we can to lower prices for the American people. Congress must act urgently as well. I call on Congress to pass a bill to cut shipping costs this month, and get it to my desk, so we can lower the price of goods. And, I call on Congress to pass legislation to cut costs for families like energy bills and prescription drugs. The deficit has come down more under my watch as President than at any time in history, but if Congress would pass tax reform to make the wealthiest Americans and big corporations pay their fair share, we could reduce this inflationary pressure even more. These are the most significant things Congress can do to help families now and complement the Federal Reserve’s efforts to bring inflation down.</p>



<p>Prices at the pump are a major part of inflation, and the war in Ukraine is a major cause of that. The United States is on track to produce a record amount of oil next year, and I am working with the industry to accelerate this output. But it is also important that the oil and gas and refining industries in this country not use the challenge created by the war in Ukraine as a reason to make things worse for families with excessive profit taking or price hikes.</p>



<p>We all have work to do to get inflation down. What will not help is the plan by some Republicans in Congress to raise taxes on the middle class and working families. That would be a step in the wrong direction, and I strongly oppose it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Delta Air Lines will carry more than 3.2 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Kendamil infant formula&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Today, President Biden is announcing that his Administration has arranged the sixth Operation Fly Formula flight. Delta Air Lines will transport Kendamil formula free of charge from Heathrow Airport in London to Logan Airport in Boston and Detroit Metro Airport between June 20 and June 24.</p>



<p>These Operation Fly Formula flights donated by Delta will contain more than 212,000 pounds or approximately 3.2 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Kendamil infant formula and will begin shipping on June 20.</p>



<p>The Kendamil Organic and Classic formula, made available through Operation Fly Formula, will be distributed and available for purchase at select U.S. retailers nationwide, as well as online. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is exercising enforcement discretion so that Kendamil can import infant formula under the Kendamil brand. Kendamil will export up to at least 2 million cans of Kendamil infant formula – the equivalent of at least 54 million 8-ounce bottles to the United States. Parents can learn more about Kendamil infant formula at&nbsp;<a href="https://kendamil.com/">https://kendamil.com/</a>&nbsp;and visit the United States website at&nbsp;<a href="https://us.kendamil.com/">https://us.kendamil.com/</a>&nbsp;for updates and information on retail locations.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the importation of safe infant formula and start getting more formula to stores as soon as possible. Under Operation Fly Formula, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense (DOD) are partnering to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S. health and safety standards so it can get to store shelves faster. Yesterday, Operation Fly Formula flights landed in Texas with 1.6 million bottle equivalents of Nestlé NAN SupremePro Stage 1 infant formula, and the first shipment of 3.7 million bottle equivalents of Kendamil infant formula landed in Virginia aboard a donated United Airlines flight.</p>



<p>In addition, the Biden Administration has taken a number of other important actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula for families, including invoking the Defense Production Act, entering into a consent agreement between the FDA to reopen Abbott Nutrition’s Sturgis facility, and issuing FDA guidance so that major formula manufacturers can safely import formula that is not currently being produced for the U.S. market.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On June 14, 1777, the Continental Congress passed a resolution adopting a flag for our new Nation &#8212; the United&nbsp;States of America.&nbsp; The resolution specified 13 alternating red and white stripes with 13 stars on a blue field.&nbsp; The stars represented the colonies that declared independence, and in the years since, they have grown into 50 United States which comprise our great country today.&nbsp; For centuries, mariners looked to the stars to guide them across the seas, just as Americans and people across the globe look to our flag as a guiding symbol of freedom, opportunity, and hope. &nbsp;On Flag Day and during National Flag Week, we celebrate the journey of progress represented in our banner and pay tribute to the inspiration it gives Americans at home and abroad.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our flag belongs to all Americans, and its red, white, and blue colors are woven into a rich tapestry of different cultures, backgrounds, and beliefs which connects us and honors our shared history. &nbsp;Old Glory has flown around the world in times of war and in times of peace. &nbsp;It has traveled to the Moon and to Mars. &nbsp;It has sailed on ships and flown on planes. &nbsp;It waves high above the White House, courthouses, post offices, schools, and homes across the Nation, and also above our embassies and military bases overseas &#8212; an enduring beacon of democracy.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Revolutionary War to the modern age, American Service members have fought bravely under the symbol of our flag, and those who give the last full measure of devotion are wrapped in its broad stripes and bright stars as they are laid to rest.&nbsp; We honor those who serve our country in uniform and pay homage to those who have made that ultimate sacrifice.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every day, the American Flag instills pride &#8212; reminding us of the ideals upon which our Nation was founded and the values for which we stand. &nbsp;As we pledge our allegiance to the Star-Spangled Banner, and the legacy it holds in our history, let us continue the work of perfecting our Union so that, together, we can deliver the promise of America for all Americans. &nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by joint resolution approved August 3, 1949, as amended (63 Stat. 492), designated June 14 of each year as &#8220;Flag Day&#8221; and requested the President issue an annual proclamation calling for its observance and for the display of the flag of the United States on all Federal Government buildings.&nbsp; The Congress also requested, by joint resolution approved June 9, 1966, as amended (80 Stat. 194), that the President issue annually a proclamation designating the week in which June 14 occurs as &#8220;National Flag Week&#8221; and calling upon all citizens of the United States to display the flag during that week.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2022, as Flag Day, and the week starting June 12, 2022, as National Flag Week.&nbsp; I direct the appropriate officials to display the flag on all Federal Government buildings during this week, and I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National Flag Week by displaying the flag and honoring all of our brave service members and revering those who gave their last full measure of devotion defending our freedoms. &nbsp;I encourage the people of the United States to observe with pride and all due ceremony those days from Flag Day through Independence Day, set aside by the Congress (89 Stat. 211), as a time to honor the American spirit, to celebrate our history and the foundational values we strive to uphold, and to publicly recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America.</p>



<p>     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>
