<p class="has-text-align-center">Via Teleconference</p>



<p>10:36 A.M. EDT<br><br>     MR. MUNOZ:  Hey, everybody.  Thanks you for joining us &#8212; Happy Tuesday &#8212; for this press call today.  We are going to outline the consequences that a lack of COVID-19 response funding will have on the United States if Congress fails to act.<br><br>     The call and the accompanying factsheet that you all just received before this will be on background, attributable to “senior administration officials,” and embargoed until 11:30 a.m. Eastern.<br><br>     On today’s call, we have [senior administration officials].<br><br>     With that, I will kick it to [senior administration official] for some opening remarks.<br><br>     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Kevin.  Good morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining us.<br><br>Today, we want to cover the consequences of a lack of additional funding for the nation’s COVID response.<br><br>I’ll discuss the near-term impacts, and then I’ll turn to [senior administration official] to discuss the impacts on our longer-term preparedness.<br><br>First, I want to step back and provide some context on how we view this moment in the pandemic.<br><br>Over the past 14 months, the country has made critical investments, using resources that Congress provided on a bipartisan basis, to make sure the American people have access to free and widely available tools: vaccines, boosters, treatments, tests, and high-quality masks.<br><br>As a result, the U.S. has made tremendous progress: Cases are down 95 percent since the peak of Omicron.  Hospitalizations are down 85 percent.  Over 215 million Americans are fully vaccinated, and over 95 million Americans have received a booster shot.<br><br>But as the President said in the State of the Union, we still have more work to do.<br><br>Our scientific and medical experts have been clear that in the next couple of months we could see COVID cases increase here in the U.S., just as we’re seeing cases rising abroad right now.<br><br>That’s why we remain laser-focused on fighting COVID and preparing for the future.<br><br>The President has laid out a comprehensive National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan to continue the progress we’ve made and to ensure we keep the country moving forward safely.<br><br>We asked for immediate funding needed to start to implement that plan.<br><br>In fact, for months, we’ve made clear to Congress, on a bipartisan basis, that the funding for tests, treatments, and vaccines was drying up and that additional funds would be needed.<br><br>In January, we notified the Hill that funding would be needed after the Omicron surge.  In February, we briefed appropriators and authorizers about the status of funds and the consequences if there were no additional funds.<br><br>We sent a formal request of $22.5 billion to the Hill, again being clear of what we could not do without more funding.<br><br>The President called for additional funding in his State of the Union address; outlined in a 96-page plan, made clear that more funding is needed. <br><br>And our team has held more than two dozen calls and meetings with members of Congress about this emergency funding request. <br><br>We have been clear: We hoped Congress would provide these resources, as lawmakers have done multiple times on a bipartisan basis under the prior administration.<br><br>Further inaction will set us back; leave us unprepared &#8212; less prepared; and cost us more lives.<br><br>We need Congress to provide the $22.5 billion in emergency immediate funding.<br><br>Now, let me walk through some of the immediate consequences of a lack of funding.<br><br>First, on vaccines: Without additional funding, we do not have the adequate resources to purchase enough booster shots for all Americans if an additional shot is needed.<br><br>Keep in mind, when Congress passed the supplemental bill in December of 2020 and the American Rescue Plan, the mRNA vaccines were envisioned as a two-shot vaccine.  We’ve now administered nearly 100 million booster shots, and four shots are now recommended and available for immunocompromised people.<br><br>To ensure enough fourth doses for all Americans or a variant-specific vaccine should we ever need them, we must have funding in hand.<br><br>Vaccines are our most effective tool.  We cannot be caught without the ability to move quickly to get more of the most effective vaccines available as soon as we are able.<br><br>Next, on treatments: To date, we have shipped over 7 million courses of treatments to the American people.  And in many cases, we have sent federal medical personnel to states to help administer those treatments.  When Omicron hit, the federal government stepped in to ramp up delivery of the last remaining treatment that worked.<br><br>These efforts have saved lives in every state in the country.<br><br>We have planned &#8212; we had planned to purchase additional monoclonals as soon as next week.  Without additional funding, we are cancelling those plans.  And as we will make clear to governors later this morning, we also need to cut the number of monoclonal antibody treatments we send to states by 30 percent starting next week.<br><br>Even with these cuts, we anticipate that our supply of monoclonal antibody treatments will run out as soon as late May.<br><br>Next, on the preventative treatments for immunocompromised Americans: We have purchased 1.7 million doses of AstraZeneca’s Evusheld &#8212; all that they could produce to date.<br><br>AstraZeneca recently told us that they will be &#8212; they will have additional supply that will be available for delivery starting in September.  These are doses we had planned to purchase as soon as the end of March.<br><br>Without more funding, the federal government will now be forced to scale back on that purchase.  So, we’ll likely run out of treatments for our most vulnerable Americans by the end of the year, if not sooner.<br><br>The bottom line on treatments is this: Without additional funding soon, thousands of patients could lose access to treatments, and these companies will have little incentive to continue investing in the development and manufacturing of these treatments.<br><br>Next, on the uninsured fund: <s>The Office of Management and Budget</s> [The Administration] notified Congress in February that this fund that reimburses doctors and other medical providers for caring for uninsured individuals was running out of money and would have to stop taking new claims in March.<br><br>Unfortunately, we’re now having to take that action.<br><br>HHS will begin to scale back this program starting next week and end it completely in early April.<br><br>This means doctors, nurses, pharmacists, labs, and other healthcare providers will no longer be reimbursed for tests, treatments, and vaccinations for people without health insurance.<br><br>And finally, in addition to all of these impacts to our domestic response, the lack of funding greatly impacts our global response.<br><br>Without more funding, USAID and our interagency partners will have to cut short efforts to turn vaccines into vaccinations around the world.<br><br>In fact, the administration won’t be able to extend surge support to over 20 additional under-vaccinated countries that will need intensive support this year to get shots in arms.<br><br>This will devastate our ability to ensure these countries can effectively deploy safe and effective vaccines.  And leaving large unvaccinated populations worldwide will increase the risk of new deadly emerging &#8212; of variants emerging that could evade our current vaccines and treatments. <br><br>Without additional funding, USAID will also be unable to provide lifesaving supplies, tests, therapeutics, oxygen, and other humanitarian aid to countries still struggling to manage a continued COVID disease burden.<br><br>Now, I’ll turn it over to [senior administration official] to discuss some of the long-term preparedness efforts at risk.  [Senior administration official]?<br><br>One second.<br><br>[Senior administration official], can you unmute?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  [Senior administration official], do you have me now?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I got you.  Go for it.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Oh, my goodness.  Okay, sorry about that.<br><br>All right.  So, thanks, [senior administration official].  Thanks, everybody.  Let me also start with vaccines.<br><br>Without additional support from Congress, NIH and BARDA will lack the funding needed to accelerate research and development of next-generation vaccines that provide broader and more durable protection, including a vaccine that protects against a range of variants.<br><br>We’ll face a similar challenge on treatments.  The current antivirals require multiple pills over several days.  We think it’s possible to get treatment courses down to one or two pills, but that requires additional research and funding.<br><br>And when a new vaccine or treatment becomes available, it’s important for us to have the funding to secure enough doses for the American people.<br><br>Over the past 14 months, we’ve put the massive purchasing power of the federal government to use, making sure America is first in line for promising treatments.<br><br>That’s the reason we’ve been able to secure more Pfizer antiviral pills than anyone else in the world.  These pills cut the risk of hospitalization and death by 90 percent.<br><br>Without additional funding, we lack the resources needed to get behind promising new treatments, meaning less supply available to the American people.<br><br>So the failure to invest in the research and the advanced purchase of lifesaving treatments and new vaccines now will leave the nation vulnerable in the face of a new variant or a new surge.<br><br>Finally, on testing: We have significantly increased our testing capacity in this country through targeted federal investments.<br><br>Without additional funding, we do not have the ability to maintain our domestic testing capacity beyond June.<br><br>So, after spending the last year building up our testing capacity, Congress now risks squandering that capacity heading into the second half of this year. <br><br>And because it takes months of ramp-up to rebuild capacity, failure to invest now will leave us less prepared for any potential future surges.  So providing funding only when cases rise is far too late to make a difference.<br><br>Bottom line: We need funding now so we’re prepared for whatever comes next.<br><br>With that, back over to you, [senior administration official].<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, [senior administration official].  Let me just close with a few thoughts here.<br><br>We have been clear-eyed and we are clear-eyed moving forward about how unpredictable this virus has been and can be moving forward.<br><br>Omicron was the most contagious variant we’ve ever seen.  It led to an unprecedented increase in cases.  But because we had the resources, we were able to surge support to Americans that needed it.<br><br>We sent tests to homes, masks to pharmacies, over 2,500 federal personnel to states, more treatments to providers.  We kept our businesses open and almost all of our kids learning in person. <br><br>That was because we had resources at our disposal to act and to act quickly. <br><br>We have a plan to keep it that way, but we need the resources to execute that plan. <br><br>The failure to provide additional resources soon will have severe consequences in the near term, as I’ve outlined: fewer monoclonal antibodies treatments, fewer tests, fewer treatments for the immunocompromised, and a risk of running short on vaccines.<br><br>We want to be clear: Waiting to provide funding until we’re in a worse spot with the virus will be too late.<br><br>Importantly, when you consider the cost of all these investments compared to the cost of what we will prevent &#8212; in terms of hospitalizations, deaths, and damage to our healthcare system and our economy &#8212; it is not a close call.<br><br>With that. let&#8217;s open up for questions. <br><br>MR. MUNOZ:  Thanks.  We have time for a few questions.  First, let&#8217;s go to Josh Wingrove at Bloomberg. <br><br>Q    Hi there.  Thank you.  Can you tell us a little bit more about the monoclonal order in terms of the scale?  Like how many were you planning to order?  If you don&#8217;t order it now, do you lose your spot in line?  And, you know, if new funding came in the following weeks, would you still be able to place that order?<br><br>And, more broadly, you mentioned, on fourth shots &#8212; can you specify: Right now, you think you have enough for immunocompromised people that are currently eligible, but without new funding, you might not have enough in the event that the broader population would need a fourth shot or be given the option to get a fourth shot? <br><br>Thank you. <br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Josh.  I&#8217;ll start, and maybe, [senior administration official], you can add.<br><br>On your first question on monoclonals, the purchase was likely to be in the hundreds of thousands of more doses.  We had planned to place that order next week on March 25th. <br><br>I can&#8217;t say whether those &#8212; you&#8217;d have to ask the company whether those would be available to us if we purchased at a later date.  That was the plan.  And as we know, these are &#8212; these are treatments that are highly sought after not just in this country but in other countries. <br><br>And so, we have to end that purchase and we have to reduce the allocations to our states by 30 percent but that we&#8217;re stretching out the supply as long as we possibly can. <br><br>On the fourth shot, we have enough now for immunocompromised individuals who need to seek a fourth shot.  What we don&#8217;t have the funding for is if all Americans were needed to get an additional dose, we would need additional funding from Congress. <br><br>And importantly, Josh, I would add that if we need a variant-specific testing, which heretofore we have been lucky enough not to need, but we want to be ready for that.  And if we need a new vaccine, we have &#8212; our gap in resources is even more severe if we need a variant-specific vaccine. <br><br>{Senior administration official}, anything you would add?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Sure, [senior administration official].  Thank you.  I think you said it exactly right. <br><br>The other thing I would just add is we have to make these purchases now so the product is available in the coming months.  It requires several months for some of the manufacturing to take place.  So, to secure our place in line, we have to make the purchases now to bring these doses forward in the coming weeks to months. <br><br>MR. MUNOZ:  Thanks.  Next question.  Let&#8217;s go to Jeremy Diamond at CNN. <br><br>Q    Hey, thanks very much for doing this.  Just searching for some more concrete numbers on the testing front.  What are we at now in terms of tests per month?  And how would that number be impacted after June?<br><br>And then secondly, if there were to be a game-changing variant spreading wildly in the U.S., you know, say, tomorrow, is the U.S. prepared for that?<br><br>And after which point in time would we not be prepared without additional funding?<br><br>Thanks. <br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Jeremy.  It&#8217;s a good question. <br><br>On tests per month, we&#8217;re in the hundreds of millions of tests per month now.  That&#8217;s because of the investments over the last 14 months in getting to that point. <br><br>We don&#8217;t know, after June, if we can maintain the domestic manufacturing capabilities that we have today.  In fact, we were told by the domestic test manufacturers that they cannot.  We&#8217;ve made investments to get us to June.  We need additional funding from Congress to not lose the gains that we&#8217;ve made over the last 14 months in the domestic testing manufacturing. <br><br>So, it&#8217;s vitally important that we continue that manufacturing so we don&#8217;t lose everything that we&#8217;ve done in over-the-counter testing in the last year. <br><br>On variants, look, what I can say, Jeremy, is we will &#8212; we are well less prepared without additional funding than we would be otherwise.  We laid out an entire plan in 96 pages of detail for how we want to be prepared moving forward and to be prepared.  We were clear in that plan, we were clear in the State of the Union, and we&#8217;ve been clear with Congress for the past few months that we need additional funding to do that. <br><br>MR. MUNOZ:  Let&#8217;s go to Rachel Roubein at the Washington Post. <br><br>Q    Hi, thanks for taking my question.  I was wondering: Have you guys had any conversations in the past few days with Congress about lowering the funding number at all from 15.6 billion? <br><br>And then, also, have you talked with lawmakers in recent days on additional pay-fors out of existing funds to replace the state and local aid pay-for that was taken out of the bill?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Rachel.  On your first question on the conversations with Congress to reduce the funding, the answer is no.  We need &#8212; we&#8217;ve submitted emergency requests for $22.5 billion, and we stand by that request.<br><br>On the pay-fors, you know, we&#8217;ll leave it to Congress the details of how they get this over the finish line in Congress.  But I think there&#8217;s bipartisan recognition that we need this money.  There&#8217;s recognition of the money they provided over a year ago has been well spent.  And we defer to Congress on the specific legislative approach. <br><br>But I will say that there is precedence, including in the prior administration multiple times, to provide direct COVID response funding on a bipartisan basis without offsets.<br><br>And so, we hope and expect that we&#8217;ll be able to rely on that precedent moving forward. <br><br>MR. MUNOZ:  Let&#8217;s go to Tamara Keith at NPR. <br><br>Q    Apologies.  Two years in, I can&#8217;t figure out mute. <br><br>Thank you for taking my question.  I&#8217;m hoping that you can sort of explain the mechanics of the markets for these various things, like why the government still needs to be involved in making these large purchases; why, you know, large hospital groups couldn&#8217;t be buying the vaccines or buying the monoclonal antibodies; like, why &#8212; why it is all so contingent on federal funds.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah.  Tamara, it’s a good question.<br><br>Look, in our preparedness plan, we outlined that we want to explore in the future the ability to transition some of COVID treatments and potentially other tools to insurance-based market, like other healthcare. <br><br>But I think our priority from the beginning is to make sure that in a once-in-a-generation pandemic that has killed over 960,000 Americans, that we&#8217;re taking the measures that are necessary to make those widely available, free, and accessible to all Americans. <br><br>That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve done with monoclonal antibody.  That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve done with the Pfizer pills and the Merck pills.  That’s what we’ve done with testing.  And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve done with, obviously, vaccines.<br><br>We think it&#8217;s the right thing at this moment to continue to move forward with that. <br><br>And I&#8217;d say most important, when we have a variant that strikes like we had with Omicron, our ability as the federal government to use our purchasing power as a government to purchase all of those things, all of those tools, and get them available to all Americans on an equitable basis saves lives.  And it was fundamental in Omicron, and I would &#8212; we would argue it&#8217;s fundamental if a variant were to come in the next few months.<br><br>So, yes, we want to explore over the long term a safe, a smooth transition.  But right now, we have immediate needs, and we need Congress to act.<br><br>MR. MUNOZ:  Let’s go to Sheryl Stolberg at the New York Times.<br><br>Sheryl?  All right, Sheryl, we&#8217;ll come back to you.<br><br>Let&#8217;s go to Zeke Miller at the AP.<br><br>Q    Hey.  Thanks for doing this.  Just to follow up on Tam&#8217;s question there: So, why not, if &#8212; you know, if the need is immediate and Congress right now shows no sign of budging, aren&#8217;t you exploring those alternate avenues?  You know, you just required private insurers to cover the cost of at-home tests.  Why not have them cover the cost of vaccines and Paxlovid and other things like that? <br><br>Why does the government still need to be the middleman there, given the current rate of COVID-impacted society and mortality?  I mean, how is that different than, you know, cancer or heart disease, other things where insurance is &#8212; the private insurance market is already effective there?<br><br>And then, separately, lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been, you know, complaining about that lack of outreach over the last several week &#8212; several weeks from the White House.  Why did it take until, you know, just the last couple of months for the White House to sort of sound the alarm here?  Shouldn’t this have been something that you all raised the alarm on last year as this &#8212; as these funds were being rapidly depleted?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Zeke.  So, on your first question, I&#8217;d say, look, we are exploring those alternatives.  We made that clear in the &#8212; in the Preparedness Plan that we released a few weeks ago.  But it takes time, as you know, to move to that &#8212; to such a system.  We &#8212; it needs to be an orderly, smooth transition.  So we&#8217;re working through that. </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;d also say, though, especially for things like vaccines, but in fact for all of our tools, the United States competes against other countries to get access &#8212; preferential access, as much as we can, to those tools.&nbsp; So we shouldn&#8217;t be fooled that if we move to this market that we would still be able to provide Americans the early access to the tools that we have worked really hard for the last 14 months to be able to provide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So if you think about a scenario where we had another variant or if we need a variant-specific vaccine, if the U.S. government sees our responsibility to provide and purchase those, you know, insurance companies would be competing against other countries to provide those, to try to purchase those, as opposed to the U.S. government stepping in and making sure that all Americans have easy, free access to something that can save their life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it&#8217;s certainly something we’re exploring.&nbsp; But it needs to be a smooth transition, an orderly transition, and there are certain places where we want to make sure that we are able to step in as the federal government and provide that access where we think it is merited.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To your second question on outreach: You know, we have been clear with Congress since mid-January that funds in our existing balances were low.&nbsp; We briefed appropriators and authorizers in February on our immediate needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also in February, we sent a document to the Hill clearly outlining the near-term consequences of no funding, which included specifically saying things like the uninsured fund would have to stop taking claims in March &#8212; we are now in March; monoclonals would stock out in May if we didn&#8217;t have funds by March; that AstraZeneca for immunocompromised would stock out this summer if we didn&#8217;t have funds in March.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We then &#8212; the Acting Director of OMB, Shalanda Young, sent a letter to Congress in March &#8212; early March asking for the $22.5 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we&#8217;ve been clear with Congress on how funds were dwindling in these accounts and that there were &#8212; there were going to be immediate consequences of that.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re making that &#8212; those consequences clear again today.</p>



<p>     MR. MUNOZ:  Next question, let’s go to Jeff Mason at Reuters.<br><br>Q    Thanks very much.  Two questions.  One, can you &#8212; I know, [senior administration official], that you said you would leave the mechanics of how Congress did this to Congress, but can you just outline what the options are at this point?  Do you expect that Democrats would have to put this into a separate bill or the reconciliation bill?  Or what is your expectation at least for options on how on how to get this across the finish line?<br><br>And secondly, I saw that Punchbowl wrote a story this morning about a letter that you&#8217;ve written to Congress about this.  Can you get us that letter or confirm that that was written?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Jeff.  So, [senior administration official] on mechanics, and I welcome [senior administration official] to jump in here after I talk if they want to add. <br><br>But, you know, I think, as I mentioned, there are many avenues that Congress can do to move to move this funding forward.  The &#8212; what we see is past precedent under the prior administration for bipartisan support for funds for direct COVID response to save lives that were provided multiple times without offsets.  So we think there&#8217;s clearly a precedent for that.  We&#8217;re asking for $22.5 billion for immediate funding, and we think Congress should move on that.<br><br>I say on reconciliation &#8212; again, I defer to Congress, but we need this money now.  These are immediate, near-term consequences, some of which we&#8217;re having to act on this week, next week, and the first week of April.  So, time is not on our side; we need we need the funding immediately.<br><br>And then on the letter to Congress that&#8217;s being sent today &#8212; and we&#8217;ll make sure that folks have access to that.<br><br>MR. MUNOZ:  Last question, let&#8217;s go to Cheyenne Haslett at ABC News.<br><br>Q    Thank you.  Hi, guys.  So, I wanted to clarify on testing: Is capacity declining this month, as we previously heard in March, or do you have enough on that front to get through June unscathed, [senior administration official], as you said, just a bit ago?<br><br>And then on Test to Treat: Can that new program still go on?  Are there enough antivirals to support that or is that going to have to be scaled back?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks.  On testing capacity, [senior administration official], I don&#8217;t know if you want to add here, but we have domestic manufacturing capability to sustain our domestic manufacturing capability until June.  And at that point, it will greatly diminish.<br><br>[Senior administration official], anything you’d add on testing?<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, I think that&#8217;s exactly right.  Due to federal support, we&#8217;ve been able to maintain this manufacturing capacity, even though as [senior administration official] mentioned, we are hearing from our domestic manufacturers that demand from other places is starting to crater. <br><br>So, it&#8217;s very important that we have this federal funding to support that manufacturing.  And we anticipate we can keep it going through June.<br><br>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks.  And then, Cheyenne, just on your second question: We do have the pills to do Test to Treat.  We do not, however, have funding &#8212; and this is clear in the materials we put out &#8212; to make any additional purchases of Pfizer pills beyond the ones that we&#8217;ve made.<br><br>MR. MUNOZ:  All right.  Well, thank you, everybody, for joining today.<br><br>As a reminder, this call is embargoed until 11:30 and attributable to “senior administration officials.”<br><br>Let me know if you have any other questions, and have a good day.<br><br>11:03 A.M. EDT</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>The U.S. has made tremendous progress in our fight against COVID-19. Over the past 14 months, the Biden Administration has made vital investments – using resources Congress provided on a bipartisan basis – to make sure the American people have free and widely available access to lifesaving tools: vaccines, booster shots, treatments, tests, and high-quality masks. As we enter a new moment in the pandemic, Congress has not provided us with the funding we need to continue the COVID-19 response and minimize the pandemic’s impact to the Nation and our economy. With cases rising abroad, scientific and medical experts have been clear that in the next couple of months there could be increasing cases of COVID-19 here in the U.S as well. As the Administration has warned, failure to fund these efforts now will have severe consequences as we will not be equipped to deal with a future surge. Waiting to provide funding once we’re in a surge will be too late.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Without funding, the United States will not have enough additional boosters or variant specific vaccines, if needed, for all Americans. The federal government is unable to purchase additional life-saving monoclonal antibody treatments and will run out of supply to send to states as soon as late May. The federal government cannot purchase sufficient quantities of treatments for immunocompromised individuals. And, the federal government will be unable to sustain the testing capacity we built over the last 14 months, as we head into the second half of the year.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, President Biden laid out a comprehensive plan to ensure that the country can continue to move forward safely and remain prepared to fight new variants and future surges of the virus. And the Administration has been clear that we need Congress to provide additional resources, including $22.5 billion in immediate emergency funding. Inaction will set us back in this fight, leave us less prepared, and cost us more lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consequences of lack of critical funding include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Inability to Secure Sufficient Booster Doses and Variant Specific Vaccines, If Needed: </strong>The federal government does not have adequate resources to purchase enough booster vaccine doses for all Americans, if additional doses are needed. The shortages will be even more acute if we need a variant-specific booster vaccine, since we will not have any existing supply.<strong></strong></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Providers No Longer Able to Submit Claims for Testing, Treating, and Vaccinating the Uninsured:&nbsp;</strong> The fund that reimburses doctors and other medical providers for caring for uninsured individuals will start to be scaled back this month and end completely in early April.&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically, one week from today – March 22 &#8212; the Uninsured Program will stop accepting new claims for testing and treatment due to lack of sufficient funds. Providers will no longer be able to submit claims for providing these services to uninsured individuals, forcing providers to either absorb the cost or turn away people who are uninsured, increasing the disparity in access to critically needed health care and putting additional burdens on safety net providers. Three weeks from today—April 5—the Uninsured Program will also stop accepting vaccination claims due to a lack of sufficient funds.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Ending the Purchase of Monoclonal Antibody Treatments, Scaling Back State/Territory Allocations:</strong> The federal government has no more funding f0r additional monoclonals, including a planned order for March 25. To date, the federal government has been able to provide these life-saving treatments free of charge to Americans and work with states to make sure they get to as many people as possible who need them. In order to keep these treatments free and available to the American people for as long as possible, the Administration will now have to stretch our current supply and, starting next week, will be forced to cut state allocations of our limited existing supply of life-saving monoclonal antibody treatments by more than 30%.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Halting Critical Testing, Vaccine, Treatment Efforts</strong>: The President’s National Preparedness Plan was clear that the federal government must invest in next-generation vaccines and treatments and maintain our testing capacity in order to fight COVID-19 in the future. Now, without additional funding, we do not have the ability to:<ul><li><em>Purchase additional oral antiviral pills beyond the 20 million already secured.</em></li></ul><ul><li><em>Pre-purchase promising new antivirals</em>. The reason why the Administration has been able to secure more oral antiviral pills than any other country is because we committed to purchasing them early, even prior to an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). As even more effective pills potentially become available, the federal government is no longer able to make advance purchase commitments to ensure America is one of the first countries in line.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li><em>Accelerate the creation of a next-generation, pan-COVID vaccine that would provide broad protection against a range of variants</em>. Vaccines are the most effective tool to prevent COVID-19, and the Administration does not have the funding for necessary investments in research and to support the development of promising new vaccine candidates.&nbsp; Such next-generation vaccines hold potential to broaden protection against known and future variants, reduce dosing through single-dose primary regimens with extended duration of protection (i.e., longer interval between boosters or possible elimination of boosters altogether), and reduce costs by increasing manufacturing yields and extending shelf life.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Maintain our domestic testing capacity beyond June.</em> After spending the last year building up our testing capacity, that progress will be squandered, the Administration will be unable to help keep domestic manufacturers online starting in June. That means, heading into the second half of the year, there will be significantly diminished domestic testing capacity and we may be unprepared for surges.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Scaling Back Planned Purchases of Preventive Treatments for Immunocompromised:</strong> The federal government has been planning to move forward with a purchase of preventative treatments for the immunocompromised as soon as March 31 that would begin delivery in September, once the treatments are manufactured. &nbsp;However, absent additional funding the federal government will now be forced to scale back that purchase of treatments for our most vulnerable. Because these treatments take more than 6 months to manufacture, the United States will likely not have enough of these treatments by the end of the year. &nbsp;And being unable to make additional purchase commitments now likely means that fewer treatments will be available next year as well. &nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Reducing Ability to Rapidly Identify and Assess Emerging Variants.&nbsp; </strong>Robust surveillance and research are critical to identify, understand and monitor emerging variants.&nbsp; With reduced capability to perform adequate surveillance, the country will be prone to being “blindsided” by future variants. In the absence of funding to immediately assess lab-based efficacy and real-world effectiveness of existing vaccines and treatments as new variants emerge, health care professionals will be forced to make insufficiently informed treatment decisions. The Administration will need to wind down some COVID surveillance investments, leaving us less able to detect the next variant.<strong></strong></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Damage to Global Vaccination and COVID-19 Treatment Efforts:  </strong>Without additional funding to support getting shots into arms, USAID and interagency partners will have to cut short efforts to turn vaccines into vaccinations across the globe.  Leaving large unvaccinated populations worldwide will increase the risk of new deadly variants emerging that could evade our current vaccines and treatments.  Without additional funds, the Administration would be unable to extend Global VAX surge support to 20+ additional under-vaccinated countries that will need intensive support this year to get shots in arms. This will devastate our ability to ensure those countries can effectively deploy safe and effective vaccines. USAID will also be unable to provide life-saving supplies, tests, therapeutics, oxygen, and humanitarian aid to countries still struggling to manage a continuing COVID disease burden. </li></ul>



<p>In addition to the immediate need for funding, in order to facilitate a smooth transition to insurance coverage of life-savings COVID treatments the Administration is requesting that Congress provides authority to ensure seamless access to Medicare and insurance coverage for treatments under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>National Task Force discussed ways to lower prices at the pump and secure true energy independence</em></p>



<p>Yesterday, National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy convened the tenth meeting of the National Climate Task Force with Cabinet members and senior leadership from across the Biden-Harris Administration. The Task Force focused on how agencies can continue supporting the President’s commitment to addressing Putin’s Price Hike from his unprovoked war against Ukraine, minimizing pain at the pump here at home, continue rapidly deploying clean energy, and keep reducing emissions that cause climate change.</p>



<p>The Task Force echoed the President’s belief that this moment underscores the need to accelerate – not slow down – our transition to a clean energy future that will strengthen U.S. energy independence. They noted when electric cars are powered by clean energy, homes run on clean electricity, and our grid is more resilient and reliable, autocrats like Putin won’t be able to weaponize fossil fuels against other nations. Officials discussed building a clean energy future by furthering the Task Force’s work every day and advancing the President’s legislative agenda that provides tax credits to save families money, lower energy bills, boost U.S. manufacturing jobs, and promote competition.</p>



<p>Task Force members also discussed progress across government to achieve the President’s ambitious climate goals. A new Climate-Smart Infrastructure Working Group outlined efforts to ensure Bipartisan Infrastructure Law investments are resilient to future climate impacts and utilize low-carbon and carbon-free materials. Energy Secretary Granholm previewed upcoming work to make schools more energy efficient and cleaner for our children. Interior Secretary Haaland discussed how the Department of the Interior is leveraging Bipartisan Infrastructure Law investments to reclaim abandoned mines and plug orphan oil and gas wells across the country. Lastly, the Council on Environmental Quality highlighted the Administration’s continued commitment to environmental justice and their progress deploying the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool.</p>



<p>As outlined by President Biden’s January 27&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/">Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad</a>, the Task Force is chaired by the National Climate Advisor and includes Cabinet-level leaders from 21 federal agencies and senior White House officials to mobilize the Biden-Harris Administration’s implementation of a whole-of-government approach.</p>



<p>Task Force membership is comprised of the following government officials:</p>



<ul><li>National Climate Advisor (Chair)</li><li>Secretary of the Treasury</li><li>Secretary of Defense</li><li>Attorney General</li><li>Secretary of the Interior</li><li>Secretary of Agriculture</li><li>Secretary of Commerce</li><li>Secretary of Education</li><li>Secretary of Labor</li><li>Secretary of Health and Human Services</li><li>Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</li><li>Secretary of Transportation</li><li>Secretary of Energy</li><li>Secretary of Homeland Security</li><li>Administrator of General Services</li><li>Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality</li><li>Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency</li><li>Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration</li><li>Director of the Office of Management and Budget</li><li>Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy</li><li>Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy</li><li>Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs</li><li>Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism</li><li>Assistant to the President for Economic Policy</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><br><em>This Equal Pay Day, the White House is announcing critical steps that the Biden-Harris Administration is taking to advance pay equity and promote women’s economic security.</em></p>



<p>President Biden and Vice President Harris have long championed&nbsp;equal pay as a cornerstone of their commitment to&nbsp;ensuring all people have a fair and equal opportunity to get ahead.&nbsp;Closing gender and racial wage gaps is essential to building an equitable economy and&nbsp;addressing&nbsp;the barriers that have long hampered women from fully participating in the labor force.&nbsp;But we still have work to do.&nbsp;In 2020,&nbsp;the average woman working full-time, year-round earned 83 cents for every dollar paid to their average male counterpart. &nbsp;Compared with the average man working full-time, year-round, disparities&nbsp;are&nbsp;even&nbsp;greater for Black&nbsp;women, Native American&nbsp;women, and&nbsp;Latinas, as well as certain subpopulations of Asian women.</p>



<p>This Equal Pay Day,&nbsp;the Vice President&nbsp;is&nbsp;hosting&nbsp;a&nbsp;virtual summit,&nbsp;bringing together&nbsp;partners across&nbsp;the country who are taking critical steps to&nbsp;tackle pay discrimination,&nbsp;create&nbsp;good-paying jobs, and&nbsp;support families’ access to care.</p>



<p>Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new actions to promote women’s employment and support working families across the country. These actions will:</p>



<p>• <strong>Advance pay equity for the Federal workforce.</strong>  The Office of Personnel Management announced that they anticipate issuing a proposed regulation that will address the use of prior salary history in the hiring and pay-setting process for Federal employees, consistent with the President’s Executive Order on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce.  Banning the use of prior salary history can help break the cycle of past arbitrary and potentially discriminatory pay that can follow women and workers of color from job to job, entrenching gender and racial pay gaps over time.</p>



<p> • <strong>Promote efforts to achieve pay equity for job applicants and employees of Federal contractors.</strong> President Biden will sign an Executive Order directing the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to consider enhancing pay equity and transparency, including by limiting or prohibiting federal contractors from seeking and considering information about job applicants&#8217; and employees&#8217; existing or past compensation when making employment decisions, and appropriate accountability measures.  The Department of Labor will consult with the FAR Council on the efficiency, economy, and effectiveness in Federal contracting that would be promoted by potential regulatory changes, and the most effective implementation strategy for any subsequent rulemaking.</p>



<p>• <strong>Strengthen pay equity audits by Federal contractors.</strong> The Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs issued a new <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/directives/2022-01">directive</a> clarifying federal contractors’ annual obligation to analyze their compensation practices.  Conducting these pay equity audits helps address and prevent pay disparities based on gender, race, or ethnicity.</p>



<p>• <strong>Ensure equitable access to good-paying jobs. </strong>The Department of Labor issued a <a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WB/media/BearingTheCostReport.pdf">report</a> analyzing the impact that women’s concentration in low-wage sectors – and their relative underrepresentation in many good-paying occupations – has on their overall economic security and gender and racial wage gaps. The report finds that, in 2019, Black women lost $39.3 billion and Hispanic women lost $46.7 billion in wages compared to white men due to differences in industry and occupation. This segregation intensified the COVID-19 pandemic’s disproportionate impact on women, in part due to the overrepresentation of women in hard-hit industries such as hospitality.  </p>



<p>• <strong>Address discrimination against caregivers.  </strong>Yesterday, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/covid-19-pandemic-and-caregiver-discrimination-under-federal-employment">published technical assistance</a> on caregiver discrimination, addressing the circumstances under which discrimination against applicants and employees based on pandemic-related caregiving responsibilities may violate federal employment discrimination laws.</p>



<p>The actions announced today build on steps the Administration has taken to advance pay equity, including:</p>



<p>• <strong>Provided immediate relief through the American Rescue Plan (ARP) to millions of women who have borne the brunt of the pandemic. </strong> This work includes: standing up a historic vaccination program that has fully vaccinated more than 215 million Americans; reopening schools; providing direct payments to individuals; expanding nutrition programs for families; providing paid leave tax credits for small and midsize employers; distributing the majority of emergency rental assistance to female-headed households; and expanding the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-whole-of-government-effort-to-ensure-child-tax-credit-reaches-all-eligible-families/">Child Tax Credit</a>, which last year helped reduce child poverty to its estimated lowest level in recorded American history.</p>



<p>• <strong>Helped keep child care providers open and boosted pay for child care workers.</strong> States have already delivered American Rescue Plan stabilization grants to more than 150,000 child care providers serving more than 5 million children and their families. One <a href="https://www.naeyc.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/user-98/naeyc_ece_field_survey_february2022.pdf">survey</a> finds that 92% of providers receiving funds relied on them to help stay open and nearly half used them to repay debt incurred during the pandemic. Many states also used funds to help boost compensation of the child care workforce. For example, Minnesota is requiring providers to increase compensation, while North Carolina and Connecticut offered bonus payments to providers who increased compensation of the workforce. Increasing compensation for child care workershelps narrow gender and racial pay gaps, as more than nine in ten are women and more than four in ten are women of color. While ARP funds allowed child care programs to provide temporary bonuses, they need long-term funding asthe President has proposed to sustainably increase wages.</p>



<p>• <strong>Provided tax relief to help families with child care costs during the pandemic by delivering a historic increase in the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) to support millions of working families this tax season.</strong> The ARP increased the maximum CDCTC for a median income family with two children under age 13 by more than sixtimes—providing up to $8,000 towards child care expenses in 2021. It will reimburse most families for up to half of their child care expenses. And the ARP CDCTC is fully-refundable, helping lower-income parents fully benefit regardless of their tax liability. Even before the pandemic, families struggled to afford child care, forcing parents and especially mothers to forego higher paying jobs, work fewer hours, or take time out of the workforce, leading to lower pay over their career. The President has urged Congress to pass his plan for child care, which could lower child care costs for nine in ten families with young children.</p>



<p>• <strong>Increased the minimum wage to $15 per hour for Federal workers and contractors, benefiting manywomen and people of color. </strong>The President issued <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/27/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-issues-an-executive-order-to-raise-the-minimum-wage-to-15-for-federal-contractors/">Executive Orders</a> directing the Administration to work toward ensuring that employees working on federal contracts and federal employees earned a $15 per hour minimum wage. Those directives went into effect in January, raising the wages of about 370,000 federal employees and employees of federal contractors. In addition to helping the government do its work more efficiently, these directives take a step towards narrowing racial and gender disparities in income, as many low-wage workers are women and people of color. The order also eliminates the subminimum wage for workers with disabilities. The President has called on Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, so that American workers can have a job that delivers dignity, and to make greater strides towards pay equity.</p>



<p>• <strong>Signed into law the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  </strong>Administration investments through this law will increase access to good-paying jobs, including for women, people of color, and members of other communities who are currently underrepresented in the sectors where these jobs will be created, such as transportation, clean energy, and broadband.<strong>  </strong>The Department of Transportation and the Department of Labor signed a <a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/OPA/newsreleases/2022/03/OSEC20220210.pdf">memorandum of understanding</a> to promote the creation of good infrastructure and transportation jobs with a focus on equitable workforce development using funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.</p>



<p>• <strong>Issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/25/executive-order-on-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce/">Executive Order</a> to promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility across the federal government – the nation’s largest employer</strong> – including by prioritizing efforts to close gender and racial wage gaps, address workplace safety and harassment, including in our national security workforce, and advance equity for LGBTQI+ public servants.</p>



<p>• <strong>Issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">Executive Order</a> on Promoting Competition in the American Economy. </strong>This established the Administration’s policy of addressing <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/State-of-Labor-Market-Competition-2022.pdf">anticompetitive behavior</a> in labor markets, which can fall heavily on women and workers of color. The Order includes specific initiatives to promote competition in labor markets, including encouraging the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to ban or limit non-compete agreements, and encouraging the FTC and the Department of Justice to strengthen antitrust guidance to prevent employers from collaborating to suppress wages or reduce benefits by sharing wage and benefit information with one another.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Freight Logistics Optimization Works (FLOW) Will Speed Up Delivery Times and Reduce Consumer Costs</em><br><br><em>White House to Host Launch Event Today with Key Industry Stakeholders</em></p>



<p>Since taking office, the Biden-Harris Administration has been focused on addressing supply chain vulnerabilities and congestion, working to speed up the movement of goods, and lower costs for families. Last year, the ports and the private sector moved a historic amount of goods with record holiday sales and delivery times below pre-pandemic levels. Currently, real retail inventories excluding autos are six percent higher than at the end of 2019 and products at grocery and drug stores are 90 percent in stock, just 1 percentage point below pre-pandemic levels.</p>



<p>The Administration is also focused on addressing the longer-term weaknesses in our nation’s supply chains, the result of decades of underinvestment, outsourcing, and offshoring instead of investment in long-term security, sustainability, and resilience. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) is now making a generational investment in our ports, highways, and other parts of our physical infrastructure, which will help speed up the movement of goods and lower costs. But we can further strengthen our goods movement supply chains by making a similarly bold improvement in a <em>digital</em> infrastructure to connect the supply chain.</p>



<p><strong>To take the first step toward addressing this challenge, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing the launch of Freight Logistics Optimization Works (FLOW), an information sharing initiative to pilot key freight information exchange between parts of the goods movement supply chain. </strong>FLOW includes eighteen initial participants that represent diverse perspectives across the supply chain, including private businesses, trucking, warehousing, and logistics companies, ports, and more. &nbsp;These key stakeholders will work together with the Administration to develop a proof-of-concept information exchange to ease supply chain congestion, speed up the movement of goods, and ultimately cut costs for American consumers. DOT will lead this effort, playing the role of an honest broker and convener to bring supply chain stakeholders together to problem solve and overcome coordination challenges. This initial phase aims to produce a proof-of-concept freight information exchange by the end of the summer.<br><strong><br>A Novel Data Sharing Partnership<br></strong><br>Recent supply chain disruptions have raised national awareness of the need for improved information exchange. Supply chain stakeholders deserve reliable, predictable, and accurate information about goods movement and FLOW will test the idea that cooperation on foundational freight digital infrastructure is in the interest of both public and private parties. FLOW is designed to support businesses throughout the supply chain and improve accuracy of information from end-to-end for a more resilient supply chain.</p>



<p>Resiliency—the ability to recover from an unexpected shock—requires visibility, agility, and redundancy. The lack of digital infrastructure and transparency makes our supply chains brittle and unable to adapt when faced with a shock. The goods movement chain is almost entirely privately operated and spans shipping lines, ports, terminal operators, truckers, railroads, warehouses, and cargo owners such as retailers. These different actors have made great strides in digitizing their own internal operations, but they do not always exchange information with each other. This lack of information exchange can cause delays as cargo moves from one part of the supply chain to another, driving up costs and increasing goods movement fragility.</p>



<p>This effort shows a strong and deliberate response by the Administration to tackle this challenge head-on and set the country on the right trajectory for a resilient and globally competitive 21st century goods movement chain. The Biden-Harris Administration is laser focused and creative in identifying ways to speed up the movement of goods from ships to shelves and cut costs for American consumers. With FLOW, the Biden Administration will play a leadership role in bringing companies together to problem solve for the American people. Initial partners in FLOW include:</p>



<p><strong>Port Authorities:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Port of Long Beach</li><li>Port of Los Angeles</li><li>Georgia Ports Authority</li></ul>



<p><strong>Ocean Carriers:</strong></p>



<ul><li>CMA CGM</li><li>MSC</li></ul>



<p><strong>Terminal Operators:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Fenix Marine Terminal</li><li>Global Container Terminals</li></ul>



<p><strong>Business:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>Albertsons</li><li>Gemini Shippers</li><li>Land O’ Lakes</li><li>Target</li><li>True Value</li></ul>



<p><strong>Trucking</strong></p>



<ul><li>&nbsp;CH Robinson</li></ul>



<p><strong>Chassis:</strong></p>



<ul><li>DCLI</li><li>FlexiVan</li></ul>



<p><strong>Logistics and Warehousing:</strong></p>



<ul><li>FedEx</li><li>Prologis</li><li>UPS</li></ul>



<p>These first partners are committed to working with the Biden-Harris Administration to identify and operationalize a first information exchange that will support a more resilient and fluid supply chain. They represent stakeholders throughout the supply chain including large BCOs (beneficial cargo owners) like Target, small and medium size businesses represented by True Value and Gemini Shippers, as well as agricultural producers such as Land O’Lakes. FLOW will be able to address issues such as ensuring early return dates are consistent across partners, measuring more accurate chassis availability and understanding aggregate dwell time throughout the supply chain. The principles of the pilot include the following: it is a voluntary, secure national exchange for freight information, it is available to participants who share data, and it is sustained by supply chain operational improvement.<br><br><strong><u>For additional interested parties, the Biden-Harris Administration is launching a webpage to gauge additional stakeholder interest in supporting foundational freight infrastructure:<br></u></strong><br>While starting with a limited pilot, DOT wants to hear from others who are interested in engaging as part of FLOW as a participant as the initiative grows. Within one month of the FLOW launch, DOT will launch a web page to gauge industry interest in participation and data sharing for a potential long-term FLOW effort.</p>



<p><strong>Building on Ongoing Supply Chain Achievements<br></strong><br>The FLOW initiative builds on previous successes of the Biden-Harris Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force to ensure cargo is getting from ship to shelf, including:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Reduced Dwell Time in Los Angeles and Long Beach.</strong> At the beginning of November, with support from the Administration, the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach proposed charging the ocean carriers for cargo that dwelled on the docks for nine days or more, which led to about a 60 percent reduction in the number of long-dwelling import containers on the docks to date.<br></li><li><strong>Alleviated congestion at the Port of Savannah</strong> by funding the Georgia Port Authority pop-up container yards project. With this policy change, the Georgia Port Authority was able to reallocate more than $8 million to convert existing inland facilities into five pop-up container yards in both Georgia and North Carolina.  Since the temporary container yards opened in late November, the container yards have provided relief to about 5,000 containers over eight weeks and freed up more dock space, speeding goods flow in and out of the Port of Savannah.<br></li><li><strong>Secured commitments to move towards 24/7 operations </strong>via a Presidential call to action to encourage every link in the goods movement chain to move towards a 24/7 pace to increase the volume and pace of products flowing through the system. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach and International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) workers joined together to make the first commitment. Some of the countries’ largest companies joined in as well—including Walmart, Target, FedEx, UPS, Home Depot, Best Buy, The Gap, and Samsung—committing to try a new solution.</li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Hotel Washington<br>Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>7:59 P.M. EDT<br><br>THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Happy to do that.&nbsp; First, let me begin by thanking you all for your commitment to the environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think maybe Mark is the only guy in here who knows that way back in the ‘80s, I wrote the first climate bill, and it didn&#8217;t go very far.&nbsp; We &#8212; we had rai- &#8212; (coughs) &#8212; excuse me &#8212; raised consciousness, but it didn&#8217;t go very far.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And let me began by saying: It is the existential threat to humanity.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s not hyperbole.&nbsp; And you got a chance to speak to my former &#8212; our former Secretary of State, John Kerry, who is as passionate about this as anybody in the world &#8212; for real.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve been going around the world trying to make sure that we keep the kind of commitment that the G28 did.&nbsp; At any rate, we &#8212; there&#8217;s a long way to go, but we&#8217;re running into some obstacles that I&#8217;m going to need your help on in terms of individuals, as well as circumstances.&nbsp; But we&#8217;ll get to that a little bit later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, Lise, thank you for &#8212; for doing this.&nbsp; You know, it&#8217;s great to be with this group again.&nbsp; An awful lot of you here supported the campaign throughout and been with me throughout the first year and a half or so of my administration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The climate crisis is the existential threat.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not hyperbole; it&#8217;s a fact.&nbsp; If we don&#8217;t keep it to 1.5 degrees Celsius &#8212; no warmer than that &#8212; we&#8217;re going to have &#8212; our kids are going to &#8212; our grandchildren will never forgive us, and the world will change.&nbsp; I mean, literal sense it will change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And before we begin the discussion, I have three quick points.&nbsp; One, clean energy is a double-edged sword to deal with the climate crisis.&nbsp; Actually, it’s not even double-edged, it’s a triple-edged sword if we think of it in positive terms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I had &#8212; years ago, when I was taken to a hospital with an aneurysm, the doctors explained to me what was going through and whether it was environmental or whether it was congenital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I said, “Doc, I don&#8217;t need to know.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to be okay.”&nbsp; He was operating at me.&nbsp; And he looked at me, and he said, “Your problem, Senator, is you&#8217;re a congenital optimist.” Well, in this job, you have to be.&nbsp; I always used to kid Barack, “A country is never going to be more optimistic than its president.”&nbsp; And I am optimistic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there are three &#8212; three things we can deal with at the same time now: climate crisis, consumer costs, and national security.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re not at odds with one another if we look at it the right way; they&#8217;re compatible.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we have to pass the other provisions in my Better Back &#8212; Build Back America plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In advance of our aggressive climate goals, we’re going to cut costs for families &#8212; an average of $500 a year.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not something anybody at this table worries about, but as my dad used to say, when everything from the price of gasoline to heating your home goes up, it&#8217;s a subject at the &#8212; at the dinner table.&nbsp; It&#8217;s real.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And &#8212; and so, that&#8217;s why this &#8212; my proposal advances aggressive climate goals, tax credits to weatherize homes and businesses, doubling America&#8217;s solar wind and &#8212; and other energy, lowering the price of electric vehicles, and &#8212; and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in addition, the Russia and Ukraine is another reason why we have to get off our dependency on fossil fuels.&nbsp; Imagine where we&#8217;d be right now if, in fact, Europe was in fact energy- free of fossil fuels and was &#8212; we were in a situation where &#8212; (coughs) &#8212; excuse me &#8212; where &#8212; where we &#8212; it was all renewables.&nbsp; It&#8217;d be a different world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And &#8212; and so, we have to get off the dependency on fossil fuels &#8212; a subject matter I’ve spoken over, I don&#8217;t know, 75 to 100 times over the last four months; trying to keep NATO together and the EU.&nbsp; I mean, literally, not figuratively &#8212; meaning both here and there.&nbsp; And the dependence of Europe on fossil fuels is &#8212; way exceeds any dependence we have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, it&#8217;s not an immediate solution to the crisis, but it&#8217;s all about the future if we were to change the fossil fuel dependency.</p>



<p>Second thing: I&#8217;m going to continue to take executive actions where I can.&nbsp; The Court has overruled me a couple of times.&nbsp; But we created a climate office in the White House to carry out the whole-of-government effort to deal with climate.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve signed executive orders ranging from the most ambitious fuel economy standards for cars and trucks to taking on super-polluting hydrofluorocarbons.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re going to continue to be aggressive on the executive front as well.</p>



<p>The third thing is we have to continue to catalyze private investment and bring everybody along, which you all know much more about that than the vast majority of Americans.</p>



<p>And the infrastructure law &#8212; it was going to take us a long way.&nbsp; For example, we’re going to provide 500,000 charging stations for electric vehicles; that is motivating both utilities, car companies, and states to invest their own money in deploying these chargers as well.</p>



<p>Ford, General Motors are making historic investments in electric vehicles.&nbsp; GM says they will be 100 percent electric vehicles by &#8212; maybe by 2035; Ford says, by 2030, 50 percent of all their vehicles.&nbsp; And this proves we can deal with climate and &#8212; crisis &#8212; and jobs.&nbsp; This creates a lot of jobs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the law also is going to help us build more climate resilience and deal with the record wildfires, floods, droughts, and other ways to get private sector into the game.</p>



<p>I have &#8212; I’ve gone to almost every major climate crisis we&#8217;ve had in the last year and a half.&nbsp; You know, you all know it, but more land has burned to the ground, including buildings and forest, than the entire square footage of New Jersey, in the West, and &#8212; primarily.</p>



<p>And, you know, we&#8217;ve had climate resilience to deal with the floods and droughts as well.&nbsp; I mean, now &#8212; you know, when the hurricane hit in Louisiana, the 170-mile-an-hour winds &#8212; 79-mile-an-hour winds &#8212; more people died in Queens from flooding than they died in that hurricane.&nbsp; Because when I went up there and visited &#8212; people went to their basements because of tornadoes and rain &#8212; 20 inches of rain.&nbsp; They &#8212; it flooded their basements; couldn&#8217;t get out, and died.</p>



<p>And so, you know, it&#8217;s another way to get the private sector into the game as well.&nbsp; Every place I go, the private sector is wanting to talk about what they can do and what they want to work with me to get done.</p>



<p>And &#8212; and, by the way, that brings everyone in: the labor unions; urban, rural and Tribal communities as well; and our young people &#8212; this is their generational cause.&nbsp; And so that&#8217;s the coalition we need to put together &#8212; business, labor, and &#8212; and including Tribal communities, and just the whole generation of young people who are &#8212; for example, my wi- &#8212; my daughter is a social worker.&nbsp; She is &#8212; runs a lot of Boys &amp; Girls Clubs around the &#8212; anyway, I called her tonight to tell her I love her.&nbsp; And her father-in-law is ill.&nbsp; And she said, “Dad, you&#8217;re talking about climate, right?&nbsp; Talking about climate.”&nbsp; And dad is talking about climate.</p>



<p>So the coalition we need to bring &#8212; bring together &#8212; is going to need your help.&nbsp; And &#8212; and there&#8217;s a lot more to say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But rather than that, since I have a call with a foreign leader &#8212; I must leave by 8:40 at the latest &#8212; I &#8212; why don&#8217;t we get on with what you want to do ne- &#8212; tell me how you want to proceed?</p>



<p>And so, I’m supposed to turn it over to Nat right now.&nbsp; They told me &#8212; that’s what I’m told.</p>



<p>(The press departs.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">James S. Brady Press Briefing Room</p>



<p>3:25 P.M. EDT<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Hi, everyone.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; Good to see you.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Good to see you.&nbsp; Okay, I have nothing at the top for you.<br><br>Josh, what is on your mind?<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; Two questions. &nbsp;First, after the Rome meeting, since the war began, has China provided any military or economic aid to Russia or expressed any specific intentions to do so?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I&#8217;m not in a position to confirm or detail any intelligence from here at this point in time.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Moving on to the Russia-Ukraine talks: What does the U.S. see that would be a sign for optimism that some kind of ceasefire could be reached?&nbsp; And which carrots and which sticks do you think Putin is most responding to, if that’s the case &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; most likely to respond to?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, as you&#8217;ve heard us say in the past, we certainly will continue to support the Ukrainian participation in these talks and conversations as long as they choose to continue to participate in them, of course.&nbsp; And we are trying to boost them by providing a range of not just economic and humanitarian assistance, but military assistance that we believe strengshens &#8212; strenghens &#8212; strengthens &#8212; excuse me &#8212; their positions in these talks.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Our view continues to be that, despite words that are said in these talks or coming out of these talks, diplomacy requires engaging in good faith to de-escalate.&nbsp; And what we&#8217;re really looking for is evidence of that.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re not seeing any evidence, at this point, that President Putin is doing anything to stop the onslaught or de-escalate.&nbsp; But that is really what we would be looking for.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Jen.&nbsp; To follow up on the Rome meeting, what are the consequences for China if they do aid Russia?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m not going to get into specific consequences.&nbsp; I think what we have conveyed and what was conveyed by our National Security Advisor in this meeting is that should they provide military or other assistance that, of course, violates sanctions or supports the war effort, that there will be significant consequences.&nbsp;<br><br>But in terms of what the specifics look like, we would coordinate with our partners and allies to make that determination.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay. &nbsp;But Jake Sullivan certainly communicated that there would be consequences?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes, as we have also said publicly a number of times.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then, is there anything you can share about the President&#8217;s potential meeting &#8212; potential trip to Europe in the next couple of weeks?&nbsp; Who he might be meeting with and really what the point would be of going to Europe?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well, we are, of course, closely engaged with our NATO partners and European allies, as you heard us say a number of times, about the next steps in diplomacy, whether that&#8217;s providing additional humanitarian or security assistance or the mechanics for future conversations.&nbsp;<br><br>But there&#8217;s not been any final decision about a trip, so I don&#8217;t have anything to preview about what that would look like if he were to take a trip.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; The President said back in February that the U.S. would respond forcefully if Americans were targeted in Ukraine.&nbsp; Brent Renaud was killed over the weekend.&nbsp; One of my colleagues was injured today.&nbsp; We&#8217;re still waiting to hear if he&#8217;s okay.&nbsp; So what is that response going to look like?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, let me first say: Your colleague, Benjamin Hall &#8212; I know there&#8217;s not final reports yet or we would wait for your news organization to confirm those &#8212; but our thoughts, the President&#8217;s thoughts, our administration’s thoughts are with him, his family, and all of you at Fox News as well.&nbsp;<br><br>In terms of specific actions, I think you have seen the President lead the world in taking &#8212; putting in place consequence &#8212; consequences, putting in place repercussions and steps in response to the actions of Russia &#8212; the brutal actions that have certainly impacted Ukrainian people and now have certainly impacted some Americans.&nbsp;<br><br>But in terms of next steps or what the next consequence would be, I don&#8217;t have anything to preview for you at this point in time.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we&#8217;ve seen the President been, so far, unwilling to draw a red line on the kinds of atrocities that we&#8217;re going to watch from the sidelines.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen maternity wards being bombed, illegal weapons being used, pediatric hospitals being targeted.<br><br>President Obama drew the red line for Syria at chemical weapons.&nbsp; So is there any thought process about what we&#8217;re willing to watch happen before there&#8217;s &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, Jacqui, I think it&#8217;s important to reiterate as often as we can that what we&#8217;re seeing is horrific, what we&#8217;re seeing is barbaric.&nbsp; And the steps that the President has taken and led the world in taking have essentially led the Russian financial system to be on the brink of collapse.&nbsp; We have provided more military assistance to the Ukrainian military and the Ukrainian government than any other country in the world and more historic assistance than any other year to Ukraine in history.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re doing that so that we can support them in this difficult moment.&nbsp;<br><br>So I would say that, at this moment in time, we have been hardly on the sidelines.&nbsp; We have been leading this effort around the world to respond to every step and every escalatory step that President Putin and the Russians are taking.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But isn’t there a concern that if we don&#8217;t draw the line at something like chemical weapons, that it&#8217;ll make it easier for malign actors to use them in the future, because they&#8217;ll just go unpunished?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, Jacqui, I think that you heard the President say on Friday that there would be severe consequences and the world would respond if they were to use chemical weapons.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And what we have been doing over the course of the last several weeks, if not months, is providing as much information to the global community, to the media, and to others about what to expect.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And when you have President Putin suggesting &#8212; and Russian &#8212; Russian officials suggesting that the United States and Ukrainians are the ones who are working on a chemical weapons program, it&#8217;s clear that this is a pattern that we&#8217;ve seen in the past of them trying to set up a predicate for their own actions.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what does &#8212; what does that end up looking like if the world responds?&nbsp; Because so far, we&#8217;ve heard the President talk a lot about what the U.S. is not going to do, in terms of, you know, not wanting to trigger war with a nuclear power.&nbsp; But do we believe that Putin is, you know, a rational kind of person who, you know, would pay attention to something like that?&nbsp; I mean, he didn&#8217;t need provocation to, you know, invade Ukraine. &nbsp;Why wouldn&#8217;t we think that he would just create a pretext that is fabricated for something like that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We do.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve talked about it.&nbsp;<br><br>And I think, Jacqui, what&#8217;s important here is &#8212; and then I’m just going to move on to get to more people &#8212; is that for any President, you have to weigh how you can lead the world, how you can make very clear that actions are horrific, that they are not acceptable, they&#8217;re not aligned with global norms, while also thinking about our own national security interests.&nbsp; And starting World War Three is certainly not in our national security interests.&nbsp; Putting U.S. troops on the ground in Ukraine to fight a war with Russia is not in our national security interests.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do have one &#8212; one quick &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I just have to move on because I &#8212; otherwise I’m not going to get to other people.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s a follow-up to what you had said though about misinformation and Twitter.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because, last year, the President worked with Twitter specifically to address misinformation on vaccines, called it a “wartime effort.”&nbsp; Has there been any conversations with Twitter to address misinformation as it pertains to chemical attacks and that kind of thing, given that the &#8212; you know, Russia has banned this platform within the country and they&#8217;re using it to, obviously, target eyes outside of the country, including within the U.S., to spread propaganda and misinformation?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We were the ones who told you all about that.<br><br>I agree.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have anything to read out for you in terms of private conversations with Twitter or any other social platform.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m happy to check and see if there&#8217;s more.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back on the Rome talks.&nbsp; Have you seen any &#8212; or did you &#8212; your colleagues see in this meeting any sign that China got the message, that they are going to heed your warnings?&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, what we&#8217;re going to be watching closely, of course, is actions.&nbsp; So beyond that, I think, as my colleagues just &#8212; just read out for you in a call that we delayed the briefing slightly to make sure you could all participate in: It was an intense seven-hour session reflecting the gravity of the moment.&nbsp; And it was an opportunity to be very clear about what you&#8217;ve heard our National Security Advisor convey publicly but more directly about what the consequences would be.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, you know, your colleagues have said that your deep concerns were conveyed about what would happen if China were to align more closely with Russia.&nbsp; Just, big picture: If China does not heed the U.S.’s warnings, if they do move forward with this, how concerned are you that this is inching closer to the world war that the President has been warning of?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, I think what we&#8217;re looking at here &#8212; one is: If China were to decide to be an economic provider, or to take additional steps, there to Russia, they only make up 15 percent or 20 &#8212; 15 to 20 percent of the world&#8217;s economy.&nbsp; The G7 countries make up more than 50 percent.&nbsp; So there are a range of tools at our disposal in coordination with our European partners should we need to use them.<br><br>But, again, we are &#8212; don&#8217;t have anything to update you on in terms of an assessment.&nbsp; This is obviously an area we&#8217;re watching closely.&nbsp;<br><br>While this meeting has been planned for some time as a follow-up from the November call that pres- &#8212; the President had with President Xi, it was a timely &#8212; an important moment to have this conversation, especially given the reports we&#8217;ve seen and &#8212; and the invasion, of course, of Ukraine.&nbsp;<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp; Oh, one more?&nbsp; Go ahead..<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just one quick follow-up, actually, to Jacqui’s questions &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; about chemical weapons.&nbsp; You know, the President, as you noted, said on Friday that Russia would pay a severe price.&nbsp; What would that price look like?&nbsp; Are we talking in the realm of more sanctions?&nbsp; Can you give us sort of any big picture about what that would entail?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That would be a conversation that we would have with our partners around the world.&nbsp;<br><br>But there&#8217;s no question if Russia were to decide to use chemical weapons, there would be a severe reaction from the global community.<br><br>Go ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So when you talk about, kind of, the possibilities for China if they don&#8217;t go along with what you&#8217;ve asked, would you say, like you&#8217;ve said with Russia, that “everything is on the table,” including ending trade negotiations, sanctions?&nbsp; Is that all on the table?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I’m just not going to be in a position to detail it further from here.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll see.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll keep having this conversation over the coming days.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But you won&#8217;t do nothing if China decides to provide military support?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We’ve been clear there would be consequences.&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that you would &#8212; you all would initiate?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then, what&#8217;s kind of your end &#8212; thinking about what an endgame looks like, as far as these conversations with China, do you want them to shift their strategic priorities and not have a relationship with Russia that it does now?&nbsp; Or are you looking for something more modest?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It’s less about changing their mind and more about making clear with them what the consequences would be should they take additional actions to support this invasion.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the additional $200 million in security assistance &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; the President signed off on this past weekend, an official said that part of it would go to anti-armor and anti-aircraft systems.&nbsp; I know the Pentagon says it&#8217;s still kind of in process right now.&nbsp; Are these &#8212; are we talking about weapon systems that have already been delivered, or is there consideration of new types of weapon systems in this tranche of funding?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; It&#8217;s a good question, Phil.&nbsp; My understanding &#8212; and just to give you all more detail: This weekend, as I think you all saw it, we announced &#8212; and I think this is why you&#8217;re asking &#8212; the President authorized an additional $200 million of security assistance, which utilizes the maximum amount of funding available to provide Ukrainians with the type of weapons they are using so effectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s really a continuity, as I understand it &#8212; let me double check this for you &#8212; of the type of weapons that they have been using very effectively on the ground to push back on Russia, both in the air and on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So that includes, as you &#8212; as you noted, anti-armor, anti-tank, and air defense capabilities and ammunition of other types, and other types of assistance to address the armored, airborne, and other threats that they are facing.</p>



<p>But my understanding, Phil, is it&#8217;s a continuation of the types of security assistance that we have been providing.&nbsp; And, of course, the President is looking forward to &#8212; there&#8217;s a significant amount of funding, as I think you all have noted, in the omnibus for Ukraine, which would enable us to provide even additional assistance to add to that package.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And then just a quick follow-up to one of Josh&#8217;s questions.&nbsp; The Deputy Secretary of State this weekend said, quote, she&#8217;d seen some signs of “willingness to have real, serious negotiations.”&nbsp; I think that differed a little bit from what we&#8217;ve heard from officials about the Russian posture up to this point.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can you elaborate on what the signs may have been &#8212; may have been seen in terms of giving the Deputy Secretary of State that view of things?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Well, she also said that they would have to back any words with actions, essentially, which I think is an important context.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>They did have talks today.&nbsp; There have been reports that they will have additional talks.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been very appreciative of the efforts of our allies &#8212; France, Germany, Israel, and Turkey, and others &#8212; to be participants in these talks at times or engage in these talks at times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, again, diplomacy requires both sides engaging in good faith and to deescalate.&nbsp; And what we&#8217;re really looking for is specific delivery of actions.</p>



<p>I think it&#8217;s important to remember that there have been five or six attempts to implement a humanitarian corridor.&nbsp; Those have not been effective.&nbsp; Those have not worked.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve seen, through video footage and others’ reports, that those &#8212; that has not been abided by.&nbsp; So that is where we are keeping our eye and focus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead, Kelly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you get a sense that as this conflict with Russia and Ukraine is happening, that other actors that are adversaries to the United States &#8212; China, Iran, North Korea &#8212; are also testing the West, with China&#8217;s work with Russia, as you&#8217;re dealing with that, perhaps with Taiwan; Iran with its rockets; North Korea also showing its provocative nature?</p>



<p>Is there a test of the West coming from some of the adversaries of the United States?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We have not assessed those to be related, as you have said.&nbsp; I mean, if you look at the Iran &#8212; the missile strike that we saw over the weekend, no U.S. facilities were hit, no personnel were harmed.&nbsp; We were not the targets of that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve obviously seen tests and information we put out publicly as it relates to North Korea.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve seen dozens of tests over the course of past administrations as well.&nbsp; So I would say we are not assessing it through those &#8212; that prism.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has the administration reached out to American companies that have property, infrastructure in Russia &#8212; to expect that to be nationalized by Russia and to lose those assets in Russia?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We have been, of course, engaged with U.S. companies &#8212; not encouraging them; obviously, we&#8217;ve &#8212; publicly applauding them.&nbsp; But they&#8217;re going to make their own decisions as private sector companies.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#8217;ve also conveyed, as we did publicly, I think on Friday, that there would be &#8212; we would certainly look to consequences should that happen.</p>



<p>Go ahead.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The former White House COVID Advisor, Andy Slavitt, has a Twitter thread today in which he talks about the potential for an increase in COVID cases this spring.&nbsp; He says, “Based on European case increases, the U.S. could see a new rise in COVID cases…”&nbsp; Are you confident the administration has the real-time data it needs to provide the best information possible to the public?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; To pr- &#8212; to assess data?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yes, we are.&nbsp; I would note that &#8212; I did not see his tread &#8212; his thread, but let me note &#8212; and I&#8217;m not sure if it was related to the BA.2 variant.&nbsp; Was it related to the BA.2 variant?</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; What we do know about the BA.2 variant, which I think is important context for people, is that it&#8217;s circulated in the United States for some time.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been watching it closely, of course.&nbsp; We currently have about 35,000 cases in this country.&nbsp; We expect some fluctuation, especially at this relatively low level, and, certainly, that to increase.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would also note that while BA.2 is more transmissi- &#8212; is a more transmissible version of Omicron, the tools we have &#8212; including mRNA vaccines, therapeutics, and tests &#8212; are all effective tools against the virus.&nbsp; And we know because it&#8217;s been in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, as we&#8217;re watching, and I think a lot of the reporting has been about, of course, the UK but also China.&nbsp; And China has a zero-tolerance policy, as you all know, but they also did not conduct their vaccination and booster campaigns with mRNA vaccine.&nbsp; So that is important context, too, as you&#8217;re seeing the impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What I would note, just to go back to your earlier part of your question, is that we are still pressing &#8212; the place where it is concerning is the fact that we need additional COVID funding.&nbsp; And we have talked about this &#8212; we talked about this a little bit in the past, but &#8212; last week &#8212; all running together.&nbsp;<br><br>But &#8212; but without COVID response resources and additional money, there could be immediate impacts on testing capacity; the uninsured fund, which offers coverage of testing and treatments for tens of millions of Americans who lack health insurance; and on our supply of monoclonal antibodies.&nbsp; And that means that some programs, if we don&#8217;t get funding, could abruptly end or need to be pared back.&nbsp; And that could impact how we are able to respond to any variant, of course.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do just want to ask you one more &#8212;&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; quick question.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We noticed the President, when he came on stage today at the Marriott, had a mask on.&nbsp; Is that something he has been advised to do, or is that something he just feels more comfortable doing?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Often he does that when it&#8217;s required by a specific event, as he did when he went to Texas last week.&nbsp; I can certainly check on that.&nbsp; He was tested yesterday and tested negative.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Jen.&nbsp; So, on Ukraine, the President has made clear that he sort of has a red line with Russia, in terms of not wanting to do anything that would get into a direct confrontation or lead to World War Three, as he puts it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m curious &#8212; I know you&#8217;re not sharing specifics, but in broad strokes, does he have a similar red line now with China assisting Russia?&nbsp; And are &#8212; is the &#8212; does he not want to get into a direct confrontation with China?&nbsp; And are there certain things he&#8217;s not willing to do because of that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Let me see if I can answer your question, but tell me if I&#8217;m not.&nbsp;<br><br>We don&#8217;t like red lines around here, so I&#8217;m not going to use that phrasing.&nbsp; But you are obviously correct that what he is &#8212; he’s been very clear and consistent about his &#8212; that he does not have the intention of sending U.S. troops to Ukraine.&nbsp; That has not changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would look at &#8212; while we are certainly watching closely the actions of China, whether &#8212; whether that is support of any kind &#8212; in support of any kind for Russia, and certainly there would be consequences to that &#8212; I do think we look at it through a slightly different prism.&nbsp; I mean, Russia is invading Ukraine actively.&nbsp; So, I&#8217;m not &#8212; but I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m answering your question or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, sort of.&nbsp; Just to follow up, I mean &#8212; right, no ground troops in Ukraine, but also, there have been other things, such as not enforcing a no-fly zone or not providing the fighter jets &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; that the President has been reluctant to do.&nbsp; So, again, you said you&#8217;re not sharing specifics.&nbsp; You said Jake Sullivan said “significant consequences” for the Chinese.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m wondering if there are certain things that you will not consider because it could lead to a direct confrontation with China that you&#8217;re reluctant to get into, the same way you are with Russia.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I just think we look at it slightly differently.&nbsp; I mean, what I&#8217;m talking &#8212; what we &#8212; why the President has been so clear about not sending U.S. troops is obviously because that would be a military conflict.&nbsp; We’re not fighting, obviously, in a &#8212; there&#8217;s no military conflict at this moment with China, nor do we &#8212; nor are we predicting that.&nbsp; So I think we just &#8212; it&#8217;s slightly different.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one just on a &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; different topic.&nbsp; How high is the administration expecting gas prices to go?&nbsp; And how much &#8212; is there a limit &#8212; not a red line but a limit at what you think &#8212; (laughter) &#8212; the U.S. public can bear?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Just flows off the tongue.&nbsp; (Laughs.)&nbsp; It&#8217;s okay.<br><br>So it&#8217;s a good question.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t have &#8212; I don&#8217;t have a prediction from here, in terms of what it could look like.&nbsp; There are outside predictors, of course.&nbsp; And, obviously, what we&#8217;re trying to do is mitigate the impact.&nbsp; You know, and you&#8217;ve seen, of course, you know, the price of oil go down a little bit.&nbsp; And the President will continue to look at a range of steps that he can take, whether it is engaging through his team, or through even himself personally, with big global producers, or it is looking at a range of domestic options.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we&#8217;ve seen it go up.&nbsp; I mean, we look at a lot of the same data you look at &#8212; AAA and other data &#8212; that shows us how much it has gone up since the period of time when Russian troops lined up on the border.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in terms of how far &#8212; you know, we still believe it will continue to go up, but we&#8217;re trying to take steps we can take to mitigate that and reduce it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go ahead, Mara.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I understand you don&#8217;t want to lay out what the severe consequences would be if Russia used chemical weapons, but I guess what I&#8217;m confused about is we know there&#8217;s not going to be any U.S. troops, no jets, no no-fly zone.&nbsp; Other than the things you&#8217;ve already done, which you have already described as severe, could you give us some examples of what more you can do since you&#8217;ve ruled out all these things?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just &#8212; when you talk about severe consequences, what does that mean, given that we know what it doesn&#8217;t mean?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; I &#8212;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I understand your question.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just not going to outline that from here.&nbsp; Those are conversations that will happen &#8212; continue to happen with our national security team and with our partners and allies around the world.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what you&#8217;re asking us to believe is that there are severe consequences that you haven&#8217;t used yet but that are not on the “no” list?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Correct.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; But you won&#8217;t tell us what kinds of things those might be?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to have those conversations privately through our national security team and with our partners around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; But &#8212; but do you &#8212; I guess what I&#8217;m wondering &#8212; what about the argument that there just aren&#8217;t any more severe consequences for you to use because most of the severe ones you&#8217;ve ruled out?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; That&#8217;s inaccurate.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just on the Fed nominations &#8212;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nice try, Mara.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212; does the White House have any assurances from any Republican senators that they would support Sarah Bloom Raskin’s nomination?&nbsp; And did Senator Manchin give the President or anyone in the administration a heads up about his opposition to her &#8212; to her nomination?&nbsp; I&#8217;m trying to figure out if that was a surprise.</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; I understand your question.&nbsp; We were aware of his position in advance of his &#8212; of Senator Manchin’s announcement.&nbsp; We are &#8212; she is one of the most qualified individuals to ever be nominated to this position.&nbsp; And so where we are now is &#8212; our focus is on continuing to work with Chairman &#8212; Chairman Brown to garner bipartisan support.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t have anything to read out for you on that front at this point.</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did Senator Manchin make you aware that &#8212; of his opposition?&nbsp; Was there a call to someone in the White House?&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the President know?&nbsp; What did that look like today?</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; I’m just not going to detail more specifics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And just one last question, if you don&#8217;t mind.&nbsp;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; Yep.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is the administration preparing to respond to the potential supplies chain shock &#8212; excuse me &#8212; posed by China&#8217;s decision to lock down the tech production hub in Shenzhen?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS. PSAKI:&nbsp; So we are, of course, monitoring this incredibly closely, and our team is quite focused on it.&nbsp; What I will say is that, because of the steps we&#8217;ve taken and a number of steps we&#8217;ve taken to better &#8212; better prepare and strengthen the supply chain, you know, we &#8212; we feel that that has helped us &#8212; will help us sustain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in terms of &#8212; right now, we&#8217;re basically in the stage where we&#8217;re monitoring with the State Department.&nbsp; What we&#8217;re looking at is, of course, as you know, the impact on some of these ports around where &#8212; the impacted areas of China.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we know here that, of course, our Port Action Plan and the work of our Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force, that we have a strong inventory that we can rely on.  It&#8217;s about 90 percent of goods at groceries and drugstores are in stock currently. And we&#8217;ve also reduced the number of import containers sitting at the docks for over nine days by over 60 percent.  <br><br>But in terms of specific impacts of ports in China, we&#8217;re monitoring it, and we don&#8217;t have a new assessment at this &#8212; in additi- &#8212; up-to-date assessment, I should say, at this point in time.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Thanks, Jen.  Is it the U.S. assessment, just to be clear, that Russia is deliberately targeting civilians in Ukraine?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, this is part of our assessment and review as we&#8217;re looking at how we&#8217;re &#8212; whether we will designate as a war crime.  And we look at this through a legal process internally.  Obviously, the targeting of civilians &#8212; and we have seen a range of very concerning video reports &#8212; other would be categorized in that &#8212; through that as &#8212; in that phrasing, but we have a process that we&#8217;re still working through here.<br><br>Q    And then, last week at a briefing, you told us that us, as reporters, should, quote, “not focus a lot” of our conversations “about the future of the United States importing oil at this point…from Venezuela.”  Were you ruling out that the U.S. would import oil from Venezuela (inaudible)?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I was saying it&#8217;s not an active conversation at this time.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Hi, thanks.  Does the White House have any reaction to Ginni Thomas acknowledging that she attended the January 6th rally?  <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I do not.<br><br>Q    And just kind of on that: Does her attendance there raise any kind of concerns about the independence of the Supreme Court, potential conflicts of interest, anything like that?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I just don&#8217;t have any more comment on it at this point in time.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Hi, Jen.  For the second time in two weeks, a group of hundreds of Haitian migrants has landed by boat in the Florida Keys.  Given the surge we saw last year in Del Rio of Haitian migration, what is the administration&#8217;s reaction to these landings?  Are there any plans to send any assistance either to Haiti or Florida?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I&#8217;m sure we can get you an update on the humanitarian assistance we provide directly to Haiti.  We are the largest, if not one of the largest, providers of humanitarian assistance in the world.  In terms of the individuals arriving, I think in Florida, as you said &#8212;<br><br>Q    Yeah, the Florida Keys.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  &#8212; I would really point you to the Department of Homeland Security.  We are still applying Title 42, and so that applies no matter which country you&#8217;re coming from.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Hi, yeah.  The President of Colombia said last week that he had offered President Biden the possibility of supplying more Colombian oil to the U.S. as an alternative to Venezuelan oil.  Is that an option that the White House is considering?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  We are continuing to talk to a range of producers on the importance of maintaining global supply.  This is not, as you know, about just the supply in the U.S. but about ensuring there is supply for the global market.  And we do appreciate our partnership with Colombia.  And President Biden did discuss a range of issues like economic recovery, energy security during their conversation.  But beyond that, I don&#8217;t have an update on what that might look like.<br><br>Q    Would you say that it is under active consideration as &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Again, they had a &#8212; they had a wide-ranging conversation, a very constructive conversation.  This is really about supply in the global markets.  But I don&#8217;t have an update at this point in time.<br><br>Q    Yeah.  And as a follow-up, Chevron is preparing to take operating control of its joint ventures in Venezuela &#8212; Reuters just reported that &#8212; in case the U.S. would grant them a special license to operate.  Is that something that&#8217;s on the table?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I think I just answered it a few minutes ago.<br><br>Go ahead.  Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Oh, yeah.  Thanks, Jen.  You said earlier in the press briefing that nothing has been decided about President Biden traveling to Europe.”  Can you confirm that such a trip is under consideration?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  We discuss a range of ways and mechanics for engaging with our friends and partners around the world, but I don&#8217;t have any more specifics for you at this point in time.<br><br>Q    Okay.  And this morning, Leader Schumer and Speaker Pelosi announced that Zelenskyy &#8212; President Zelenskyy of Ukraine &#8212; <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.<br><br>Q    &#8212; will be delivering an address to the full House and Senate on Wednesday morning.  What&#8217;s the White House reaction to this address?  Are there any concerns that the White House has about the Ukrainian President speaking directly with Congress as opposed to the White House on its various positions and requests?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  We speak frequently with President Zelenskyy.  The President spoke with him &#8212; had a lengthy conversation with him directly on Friday, and we&#8217;re in touch with Ukrainian government officials nearly every day &#8212; not every day. <br><br>We certainly support leaders in Congress inviting him to address a joint session.  And I would again reiterate that there&#8217;s strong, bipartisan support for Ukraine, for the leadership, and the bravery of President Zelenskyy.  And we&#8217;ll all look forward to watching his speech on Wednesday.<br><br>Q    And then, finally, on Sarah Bloom Raskin and Senator Manchin’s announcement that he doesn&#8217;t support her confirmation: Does the White House still see a path to getting her confirmed in the evenly divided Senate?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  We are going to continue our work with Chairman Brown to garner bipartisan support.  But again, she is one of the most qualified individuals ever to be nominated to this position.  So that&#8217;s where our focus is.<br><br>Q    So you are pushing her forward still and &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Yes.<br><br>Q    &#8212; and believe that you can get her &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Yes.<br><br>Q    &#8212; confirmed?  Okay.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  That is where our focus is.  We wouldn&#8217;t be pushing for bipartisan support if she wasn&#8217;t still our nominee. <br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Thanks, Jen.  Two questions on WNBA star Brittney Griner.  Last week you had said you couldn&#8217;t comment on the case.  Is there any update you can give now on the efforts the administration may be taking to secure her release?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  We do not have a Privacy Act waiver.<br><br>Q    Okay.  And does the White House have any reason to believe that Griner is being used as a political pawn by the Russian government?  Or does the administration see this strictly as part of the Russian criminal justice<br>system? <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  We just can&#8217;t speak any more to the reports of this case. <br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Hey, Jen.  Thank you very much, Jen.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I’ll come back to you.  Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Thank you.  On the possible trip to Europe: Is President Biden considering visiting, maybe, perhaps the Ukrainian border and visit refugees &#8212; Ukrainian refugees &#8212; like other foreign leaders are doing?  Is this something you&#8217;d like to do?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I just don&#8217;t have anything more on the reports.  Again, we have a range of conversations with our NATO partners and European allies about the next steps in diplomacy, but I don&#8217;t have anything to confirm for you in terms of the report.<br><br>Q    And just one more.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.<br><br>Q    Not just China but some of the biggest countries in the world, like India or Brazil, some countries in Latin America like Mexico, they&#8217;re not part of this economic war &#8212; warfare against Russia.  Is this something that undermine the efforts from this White House and European countries?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I would say it doesn&#8217;t undermine our efforts.  We&#8217;ve been working to build a global coalition far beyond the G7 and our NATO partners, and had a great deal of success in that.  And every country has to decide where they want to stand, where they want to be as we look and the history books are written.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    And you believe the &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I think we&#8217;ve got to move on.  We&#8217;ve got to get around.  <br><br>Q    Just very quickly.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Okay.<br><br>Q    Do you just believe this economic pressure will stop Vladimir Putin from his invasion?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think as we&#8217;ve seen, the impact of the President&#8217;s leadership on the global stage and the economic consequences that have been put into place have led Russia and the Russian economy to be on the brink of collapse.  And there&#8217;s no question that, over time, that will have an impact.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Oh, actually &#8212; thank you.  Furthering that point, you did mention at the top of this briefing that there has been no action on the part of Putin to stop the onslaught; you haven&#8217;t seen any action. <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q    And that is after, again, all of these severe economic sanctions have been levied.  And so, you know, I&#8217;m wondering why the administration thinks that this threat of further severe action that is vague, that is unnamed will deter him from using chemical weapons.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I think the reason that we spoke out last week about chemical weapons is because we felt that it was important for the global community to understand that they had the capacity, the capabilities, and that they have used them in the past.  And at the same time, they were accusing, inaccurately &#8212; they were spreading false information about the U.S. and the Ukrainians’ intentions.  That was the origin of why we were so outspoken last week. <br><br>So, this is more about us making clear to the world what we&#8217;ve seen as patterns in the past and what their capabilities and capacities are.  <br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Thank you, Jen.  President Biden has repeatedly said, “No U.S. troops inside Ukraine.”<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Mm-hmm.<br><br>Q    Are there any U.S. troops still training Ukrainians outside Ukraine?  And if not, could that be a thing, as we move<br>forward, if this turns into (inaudible)?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:   You mean in neighboring countries?<br><br>Q    Yeah, like bases outside Ukraine.  And if it becomes a long-term conflict, as obviously many predict, would that be a thing the United States does?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Let &#8212; let me check with the Department of Defense.  We obviously had trainers on the ground for a period of time.  We hadn’t &#8212; then we pulled them back.  We obviously have a significant military presence in a range of countries in the region, but I can see if there&#8217;s anything that we are looking ahead to.<br><br>Q    That wouldn’t be considered an escalatory type of thing?  You know, a bit like the MiGs, which got complicated because no one knew kind of how to get them to the Ukrainians.  Like, if you had Ukrainian soldiers going into Poland &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Sure.<br><br>Q    &#8212; being trained by U.S. troops to go back and fight Russians.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I mean, I think, really, our focus right now is on providing them and continuing to expedite the military assistance to them.  And the good news is that we still &#8212; through our coordination with them and our NATO Allies, we’re able to get them that assistance on the ground.  They&#8217;re actively fighting now, so that&#8217;s where our focus really is at this point in time. <br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Yeah, on the Federal Reserve: Would the administration then support the four nominees, who seem to have the votes to be confirmed, to go forward and deal with the Raskin nominee after?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, there&#8217;s enough support to move all five nominees through the committee.  So we think the Republicans should show up so that they can vote them through the committee.<br><br>Q    And on &#8212; one last thing.  The fact that China is in the conversation about helping Russia, should U.S. companies then look at maybe decoupling from China with their investments there and be cautious?  What&#8217;s the message that you have?  Can you trust the Chinese?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s about trust, but we have not made an ask or a request at this point of that. <br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Jen, thank you.  At the Democratic retreat in Philadelphia last week, some of my colleagues were hearing a lot from Democratic lawmakers who want the President to do more by executive action, whether it&#8217;s on immigration or whether it is on some of the other priorities of the administration.  Did he have any conversations with the members there about possible further executive actions?  And is there anything else &#8212; I think you&#8217;re hearing from the members in those meetings with the Black Caucus and other members of Congress in the last week or two &#8212; that may be coming forward?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say all of these members can speak for themselves on what they&#8217;re interested in and what they&#8217;re requesting from the President and from this administration. <br><br>We have a range of executive authorities &#8212; the President does, I should say, has a range of executive authorities.  I think there have been some reports about some that are under consideration, including one on policing, which we have talked about a bit in the past. <br><br>So, sure, we still continue to consider what steps we can take through executive actions, even as we work with Congress to see what we can move through there as well.<br><br>Q    And I take it that there&#8217;s no update beyond the legal review continuing on the student loan question. <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I don&#8217;t have an update at this point in time.  No.<br><br>Go ahead in the back.  Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Thank you.  Me?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Okay.  And then I&#8217;ll go to your friend next to you. <br><br>Q    Thank you very much.  On North Korea, it is reported that the North Koreans’ ICBM launch is imminent.  Do you have anything on the North Korea&#8217;s imminent launch (inaudible) ICBM?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I don&#8217;t have anything on that report.  I&#8217;ve not seen that report.  What I can tell you is that, you know, as you know, last week, we proactively decided to reveal information publicly about recent tests and share it with allies and partners as well as Congress. <br><br>We have seen North Korea escalate its testing in different periods over the last four presidents.  And this time, North Korea hid these tests, unlike the fanfare over past tests.<br><br>But I don&#8217;t have anything to predict in terms of the future. <br><br>I said I’d go to &#8212; go ahead.<br><br>Q    Japan and some of the other treaty countries are increasingly alarmed after Afghanistan and this recent situation.  Could you let the Japanese government know that the Security Treaty will be honored? <br><br>And then second, for those of us that were embedded during the war, the whole situation with Afghanistan is quite personal.  There&#8217;s a large number of our people that helped us that are still left.  Could you just update us on &#8212; almost six months &#8212; whether they&#8217;ll be able to come back?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say on the second part, that that is one of the reasons that we&#8217;ve worked so closely with our Qatari &#8212; with the Qataris to maintain a diplomatic presence there so that we continue to engage with neighboring countries to bring people home and help some of our partners and allies who stood by our side, fought by our side over the course of the 20-year war.  That&#8217;s ongoing. <br><br>In terms of the numbers, I would point you to the State Department who would have the most up-to-date numbers. <br><br>I&#8217;m not sure I understand your first question.<br><br>Q    Well, just a reassurance to Japan and a lot of the countries that have treaties with us that are worried &#8212; you know, if a situation like this develops, if those treaties are going to be honored. <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Which situation?  How would it relate to Japan?<br><br>Q    Well, Afghanistan is a long partner of ours.  And so,<br>you know, the whole situation that&#8217;s happening now &#8212; Taiwan &#8212; there&#8217;s a great concern that if you have a treaty and it comes to a difficult situation, whether it&#8217;s really going to be honored.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  We&#8217;ve never stepped back from the commitments we&#8217;ve made under the Taiwan Relations Act.  And the President stands by those. <br><br>Go ahead, James.<br><br>Q    Thank you very much, Jen.  Two questions on Russia/Ukraine.  Prior to February 24, the President, our NATO Allies, and the EU were embarked on a deterrence project.  That&#8217;s exactly the word that you and other senior U.S. officials used at the time. <br><br>Quite clearly, the invasion was launched on the 24th of February.  And so we can say, as a factual matter, that that deterrence project failed.  Is it the view of the White House that Mr. Putin could not be deterred by any set of steps?  Or are you willing to concede that perhaps some other set of steps by the President and our allies might have deterred the invasion?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  You know, James, I would say that when we put in place the threat of sanctions and the threat of consequences, we never thought that that would be failproof or that would be 100 percent effective.  We did that because we wanted to lay out the clear consequences should President Putin proceed in invading Ukraine, even as we predicted, quite consistently, that that was very much his intention. <br><br>And what we have done since that point in time is implement those sanctions and implement those consequences, far beyond what I think most people&#8217;s expectations were in the world about what those would look like.  <br><br>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s &#8212; I don&#8217;t think I can look in a rearview mirror, or any of us can, and predict what would have been different.  What we did is we took steps to rally the world to stand up to the aggressions of President Putin.  And we have implemented them and followed up on what we committed to since that point in time.<br><br>Q    One key decision made by the President early on was to remove strategic ambiguity from this equation.  Never really was Mr. Putin forced to wonder what consequences he would face.  He was told at the outset he would never face military intervention by the United States and NATO, that the full range of the punishments he would face would amount to diplomatic and economic sanctions. <br><br>I think a lot of people wonder why a greater effort wasn&#8217;t made to leave Mr. Putin in doubt about the consequences he might face.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Because the President is the President of the United States of America, and he felt it was important to be clear with the American people about what his intentions were and what they were not.  <br><br>And his intentions were not to send men and women, their sons and daughters to fight a war in Ukraine against Russia. <br><br>Go ahead. <br><br>Q    Thank you.  On Iran. <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Okay, I&#8217;ll do bo- &#8212; go ahead.  Ladies first.  Okay, go ahead.<br><br>Q    Thank you.  On Iran: The Iran talks appeared to have stalled amid some last-minute demands by Russia.  Are the Iran talks dead?  And if not, what now?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, right now, the negotiators are back home in their capitals.  We&#8217;ll see what happens in the days ahead with diplomacy around the deal. <br><br>We continue to believe that, you know, obviously, a diplomatic path forward is the best path forward.  But this is a natural part of the process.  It is also standard for the most difficult parts of the conversation &#8212; negotiations to be happening at the end. <br><br>Q    And then, just on Ukraine: South African President Cyril Ramaphosa says he&#8217;s been asked to mediate between Russia and Ukraine.  Would the White House support that, endorse that, in any way assist with that, especially since the African model kind of tends towards, like, restorative justice, truth, and reconciliation instead of, you know, traditional justice?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I&#8217;m happy to check with our national security team on his role.<br><br>What I can tell you is that there have been a half a dozen global leaders who have been meeting with both the Russians and the Ukrainians and engaging, of course, directly through diplomatic channels and trying to come to a diplomatic conclusion here.<br><br>We have been engaged directly with them on the front end and back end of those conversations, and encourage them to also make sure they are engaging with the Ukrainians and not just the Russians.<br><br>But I will check if there&#8217;s any specific &#8212;<br><br>Q    (Inaudible) South Africans about this offer (inaudible)?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I&#8217;m happy to check specifically.  But again, there&#8217;s a range of countries that are already playing this role.  So &#8212;<br><br>Go ahead.  In the &#8212; go ahead.<br><br>Q    With the COVID &#8212; thank you, by the way.<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Sure.<br><br>Q    With COVID funds falling off the omnibus &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.<br><br>Q    &#8212; and it may take a bit &#8212; you know, if Congress kind of (inaudible) get done &#8212; has the White House ask changed at all?  Have they come back to, you know, lawmakers and said, “Hey, while it’s going to take a while, you know, we need more,” or it’s in a different place?  I’m just curious how that &#8212;<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  You mean in terms of asking for less money or something like that?   Or &#8212;<br><br>Q    Or more?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Or more money.  Yeah.<br><br>Q    You know, my question is: What is the timing &#8212; and does the timing change the needs of the White House?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, the time &#8212; I mean, we&#8217;re asking for money to meet exactly the needs that are going to start to come up soon in the coming &#8212; in the coming weeks even, and in supporting a number of the programs that have been pivotal to people across this country, especially people who are uninsured, people who are relying on access to free treatments, testing, vaccines.<br><br>Obviously, these are programs that it&#8217;s not only in the United &#8212; in the U.S. government&#8217;s interest to continue, but it&#8217;s in the interest of the American people, especially people who don&#8217;t have the resources to cover and pay for a lot of these different treatments. <br><br>We had originally &#8212; we had requested $22.5 billion, I think you&#8217;re aware, for immediate and urgent COVID response needs because that is the funding we felt we needed.  That does not mean it would cover the needs in &#8212; forever.  That would just be the needs we have at this moment in time. <br><br>So these conversations are still ongoing with leaders in Congress.  We are &#8212; but we want to be very clear about the fact that some of these programs could abruptly end and be pared back without additional funding.<br><br>Q    A real quick follow-up.  Just &#8212; you mentioned the uninsured, about the HRSA program that reimburses from uninsured funds.  You guys previously said that would end this month.  Is that timeline still there?  I mean, is that &#8212; <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  You mean if we don&#8217;t have funding?<br><br>Q    Yeah.  Is it still the end of the month they shut that down?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  A lot of these programs could end quite abruptly.  So, it could.  But I will check and see if that specific one would.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Q    Jen, real quick on Title 42 &#8212; two related questions. <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Yeah.<br><br>Q    One of them: Democratic senators and congresspeople and activists are criticizing the President.  During the campaign, he said that this Trump-era policy was inhumane, yet he&#8217;s keeping it, even though the country is opening again.  But then, a few days back, the CDC decided to let unaccompanied minors in.  So the fear is that this is going to make a lot of parents just send their children by themselves and lead to another humanitarian tragedy at the border.  <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, I would say, first &#8212; I mean, as you&#8217;ve noted, the CDC makes determinations about Title 42.  I think, as it relates to the recent decision, I&#8217;d have to talk to the Department of Homeland Security specifically about that and how they&#8217;re applying it or implementing it. <br><br>As you know, our intention is certainly not to put more children at da- &#8212; in danger or put them &#8212; incentivize parents sending kids on a journey that&#8217;s treacherous and dangerous across the border.  <br><br>But the President &#8212; you know, he is implementing this because we are still in the middle of a public health crisis.  That continues to be the case, as <s>designed</s> [designated] by the CDC.<br><br>Q    But he still plans to reopen the border and make more humane policy, like he promised?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  That is &#8212; that is what he proposed on his first day in office.  And we are very supportive of the efforts in the Senate to do exactly that. <br><br>And just because it&#8217;s not done yet, it doesn&#8217;t mean that we aren&#8217;t going to stay at the fight to get exactly that accomplished and done.<br><br>Q    Jen, is there any reason why you have not condemned racism against Africans in Ukraine?  I understand that Ukrainians are the victims here; they are being bombed by Russia, and they are being killed.  But a lot of Africans, they are facing racism.  I know you are providing a lot of financial assistance to Poland and to Ukraine, but Africans there are being banned from even entering Poland.  Why have you not officially &#8212; the White House &#8212; issued a statement condemning racism against Africans in Ukraine?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  We have, and I believe the State Department has.  But we have spoken out against that and expressed concern about any reports of discrimination or &#8212; at the border.<br><br>Q    And then finally, if I may: I&#8217;m trying to understand where you&#8217;re trying &#8212; your endgame in Ukraine.  You&#8217;re not going there.  You&#8217;re not sending troops there.  There will be no fly &#8212; no no-fly zone over Ukraine.  And are you &#8212; will it be a fair assessment to say that you are pushing these guys to commit suicide, knowing that Russia has a superpower and, eventually, it will capture the main cities, Kyiv and Kharkiv, and other these cities around there?  What&#8217;s the endgame? <br><br>MS. PSAKI:  Well, the endgame is really a question for President Putin.  We have &#8212; we have completely crushed his economy.  We have provided military assistance, humanitarian assistance to the Ukrainians, enabling them to fight back for far longer than the Russian leadership anticipated. <br><br>And, again, he has to &#8212; he has to determine what the path forward looks for &#8212; like for him. <br><br>Thanks, everyone.<br><br>Q    Jen, can you confirm or deny the rumors that there are Russian hit squads in Kyiv going after journalists?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I don’t have any details on that for you. <br><br>Q    But you’ve heard of it?<br><br>MS. PSAKI:  I can see if there’s more.</p>
